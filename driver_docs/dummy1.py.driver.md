# Purpose
This code is a very simple script that outputs the string "new file" to the console. It provides extremely narrow functionality, serving primarily as a placeholder or a basic test to ensure that a Python environment is set up correctly and can execute scripts. The script does not perform any complex operations or computations, nor does it accept input or produce variable output. Its simplicity suggests it might be used as a starting point for further development or as a basic check in a larger workflow.
