# Purpose
This code is a very simple script that outputs the string "new file" to the console. It provides extremely narrow functionality, serving primarily as a basic demonstration or placeholder script. The script does not perform any complex operations, take any input, or produce any output beyond the single print statement. It might be used as a starting point for a new Python file or as a test to ensure that the Python environment is set up correctly to execute scripts.
