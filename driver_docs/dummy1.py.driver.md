# Purpose
This code is a very simple script that prints the string "new file" to the standard output. It provides extremely narrow functionality, serving primarily as a placeholder or a basic test to ensure that a Python environment is set up correctly and can execute a script. The script does not perform any complex operations, take any input, or produce any output beyond the single line of text. It is likely used for demonstration purposes or as a starting point for further development.
