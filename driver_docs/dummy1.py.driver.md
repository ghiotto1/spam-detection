# Purpose
This code is a short script that serves a very narrow purpose: it simply prints the string "test file 1" to the standard output. It is likely used for testing or demonstration purposes, such as verifying that a Python environment is correctly set up and can execute scripts. The script does not perform any complex operations or include any variables, functions, or classes, making it a straightforward example of basic output functionality in Python.
