# Purpose
This C source code file provides a set of memory allocation and string manipulation functions that enhance the standard C library functions by incorporating error checking and handling. The functions defined in this file, such as [`xmalloc`](#xmalloc), [`xcalloc`](#xcalloc), [`xrealloc`](#xrealloc), and [`xstrdup`](#xstrdup), are designed to ensure that memory allocation operations do not fail silently. Instead of returning `NULL` on failure, these functions call a `fatalx` function, which is presumably defined elsewhere, to handle errors in a consistent and controlled manner. This approach is particularly useful in applications where robustness and reliability are critical, as it prevents the program from continuing execution in an undefined state due to memory allocation failures.

The file is part of a larger project, as indicated by the inclusion of a project-specific header file, "tmux.h". The functions provided here are likely intended to be used throughout the project to replace standard memory and string functions, ensuring that all such operations are subject to the same rigorous error handling. This file does not define a public API or external interface but rather serves as an internal utility library to be used by other components of the project. The consistent use of `fatalx` for error handling suggests a centralized error management strategy, which can simplify debugging and improve the maintainability of the codebase.
