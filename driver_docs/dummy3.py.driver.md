# Purpose
This code is a very short script that prints the string 'new file' to the standard output. It provides extremely narrow functionality, serving primarily as a placeholder or a simple test to verify that a Python environment is set up correctly and can execute a script. The script does not perform any complex operations or computations and does not include any variables, functions, or external dependencies. Its simplicity suggests it might be used as a starting point for further development or as a basic check in a larger workflow.
