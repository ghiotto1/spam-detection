# Purpose
This code is a very simple script that prints the string "new file" to the standard output. It provides extremely narrow functionality, serving primarily as a placeholder or a basic test to ensure that a Python environment is set up correctly and can execute scripts. The script does not perform any complex operations or computations and does not include any variables, functions, or external dependencies. Its purpose is likely to verify that a new file can be created and run without errors, making it useful for initial setup or educational demonstrations.
