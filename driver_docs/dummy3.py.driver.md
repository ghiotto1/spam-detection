# Purpose
This code is a short script that serves a very narrow and specific purpose: it simply prints the string 'new file' to the console. It does not perform any complex operations or computations, nor does it include any variables, functions, or classes. This type of script is often used as a placeholder or a basic test to ensure that a Python environment is set up correctly and can execute a script without errors.
