Prints "new file".

# Purpose
This code is a simple script that outputs the string "new file" to the standard output. It uses the `print` function to display the message. The script provides narrow functionality, as it only performs a single action of printing a predefined message. This type of code is often used for testing or as a placeholder in a larger program.
