The `dummy1.py` file in the `spam-detection` codebase contains a simple script that prints the message "new file".

# Purpose
This code is a very simple script that outputs the string "new file" to the console. It provides extremely narrow functionality, serving primarily as a placeholder or a basic test to ensure that the Python environment is set up correctly and can execute a script. The script does not perform any complex operations or computations and does not include any variables, functions, or external dependencies. Its primary purpose is likely to verify that a new file can be created and run without errors.
