The `dummy1.py` file in the `spam-detection` codebase contains a simple print statement that outputs "new file".

# Purpose
This code is a very simple script that prints the string "new file" to the standard output. It provides extremely narrow functionality, serving primarily as a placeholder or a basic test to ensure that a Python environment is set up correctly and can execute a script. The script does not perform any complex operations or computations and does not include any variables, functions, or external dependencies. Its purpose is likely to verify that the Python interpreter is functioning or to serve as a starting point for further development.
