Prints "new file".

# Purpose
This code is a simple script that outputs the string "new file" to the standard output. It serves a narrow functionality, primarily for testing or demonstration purposes, such as verifying that a Python environment is correctly set up to execute scripts. The script does not take any input or produce any output beyond the printed message.
