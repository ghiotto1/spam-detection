The `dummy1.py` file in the `spam-detection` codebase contains a simple script that prints the message "new file".

# Purpose
This code is a very simple script that outputs the string "new file" to the console. It provides extremely narrow functionality, serving primarily as a basic demonstration of the `print` function in Python. The script does not perform any complex operations or computations and does not include any variables, functions, or classes. It is likely intended for educational purposes, such as illustrating how to execute a Python script or verifying that a Python environment is correctly set up to run code.
