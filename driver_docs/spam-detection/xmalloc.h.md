Memory allocation functions that check results and handle errors by calling fatal.

# Purpose
The code is a C header file that declares a set of memory management and string manipulation functions. These functions, such as [`xmalloc`](<#xmalloc>), [`xcalloc`](<#xcalloc>), [`xrealloc`](<#xrealloc>), and [`xstrdup`](<#xstrdup>), are designed to handle memory allocation and reallocation while checking for errors. If an error occurs, these functions call a fatal error handler instead of returning failure. The file also includes functions like [`xasprintf`](<#xasprintf>) and [`xsnprintf`](<#xsnprintf>) for formatted string operations, which ensure that the operations are safe and error-checked. The header uses preprocessor directives to prevent multiple inclusions and defines a macro `__bounded__` for compatibility with certain compilers.
# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### xmalloc<!-- {{#callable_declaration:xmalloc}} -->
[View Source →](<../../xmalloc.h#L26>)

Allocates memory and checks for allocation success.
- **Description**: Use this function to allocate a specified amount of memory. It ensures that the allocation is successful by terminating the program if the allocation fails or if the requested size is zero. This function is useful in scenarios where memory allocation failure is considered a critical error and should not be handled by the caller.
- **Inputs**:
    - `size`: Specifies the number of bytes to allocate. Must be greater than zero. If zero, the function will terminate the program.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the allocated memory block. The program terminates if allocation fails.
- **See Also**: [`xmalloc`](<xmalloc.c.md#xmalloc>)  (Implementation)


---
### xcalloc<!-- {{#callable_declaration:xcalloc}} -->
[View Source →](<../../xmalloc.h#L27>)

Allocates and zeroes memory for an array.
- **Description**: Use this function to allocate memory for an array of elements, where each element has a specified size. It ensures that the allocated memory is initialized to zero. This function must not be called with zero for either parameter, as it will terminate the program with an error message. It is useful when you need guaranteed memory allocation without handling allocation failures, as it will not return on failure but instead terminate the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `nmemb`: The number of elements to allocate. Must be greater than zero. If zero, the program will terminate with an error.
    - `size`: The size of each element in bytes. Must be greater than zero. If zero, the program will terminate with an error.
- **Output**: A pointer to the allocated memory, which is initialized to zero. The program will terminate if memory allocation fails.
- **See Also**: [`xcalloc`](<xmalloc.c.md#xcalloc>)  (Implementation)


---
### xrealloc<!-- {{#callable_declaration:xrealloc}} -->
[View Source →](<../../xmalloc.h#L28>)

Reallocates memory to a new size.
- **Description**: Use this function to change the size of a previously allocated memory block. It reallocates the memory pointed to by the given pointer to the specified new size. This function does not return on failure; instead, it terminates the program. It is important to ensure that the pointer provided was previously allocated by a compatible memory allocation function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ptr`: A pointer to the memory block to reallocate. Must not be null unless the intention is to allocate a new block. The memory must have been previously allocated by a compatible function.
    - `size`: The new size for the memory block in bytes. Must be greater than zero.
- **Output**: A pointer to the reallocated memory block, which may be at a different location than the original.
- **See Also**: [`xrealloc`](<xmalloc.c.md#xrealloc>)  (Implementation)


---
### xreallocarray<!-- {{#callable_declaration:xreallocarray}} -->
[View Source →](<../../xmalloc.h#L29>)

Reallocates memory for an array with error checking.
- **Description**: Use this function to resize an existing memory block for an array, ensuring that the operation does not fail silently. It is important to provide non-zero values for both the number of elements and the size of each element, as the function will terminate the program if either is zero. This function is suitable when you need to ensure that memory allocation errors are handled by terminating the program, rather than returning a null pointer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ptr`: Pointer to the memory block to resize. Can be null, in which case the function behaves like `xmalloc`.
    - `nmemb`: Number of elements in the array. Must be greater than zero.
    - `size`: Size of each element in bytes. Must be greater than zero.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the newly allocated memory block. The program terminates if allocation fails.
- **See Also**: [`xreallocarray`](<xmalloc.c.md#xreallocarray>)  (Implementation)


---
### xrecallocarray<!-- {{#callable_declaration:xrecallocarray}} -->
[View Source →](<../../xmalloc.h#L30>)

Reallocates and zeroes memory for an array.
- **Description**: Use this function to resize an existing memory block for an array while ensuring that any newly allocated memory is zeroed. It is useful when you need to increase or decrease the size of an array and want the new elements to be initialized to zero. This function does not return on failure; instead, it terminates the program. Ensure that the `nmemb` and `size` parameters are non-zero before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ptr`: Pointer to the existing memory block. Can be NULL if no memory is currently allocated.
    - `oldnmemb`: Number of elements in the current memory block. Must be a valid size.
    - `nmemb`: New number of elements for the memory block. Must be greater than zero.
    - `size`: Size of each element in bytes. Must be greater than zero.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the reallocated memory block. The program terminates if allocation fails.
- **See Also**: [`xrecallocarray`](<xmalloc.c.md#xrecallocarray>)  (Implementation)

### xstrdup<!-- {{#callable_declaration:xstrdup}} -->
[View Source →](<../../xmalloc.h#L31>)

Duplicates a string with error handling.
- **Description**: Use this function to create a duplicate of a given string. It allocates memory for the new string and copies the content from the input string. If memory allocation fails, the function will terminate the program. This function is useful when you need a copy of a string that is independent of the original. Ensure that the input string is valid and not null before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `str`: A pointer to a null-terminated string that you want to duplicate. Must not be null. The caller retains ownership of the original string.
- **Output**: A pointer to the newly allocated duplicate string. The caller is responsible for freeing this memory.
- **See Also**: [`xstrdup`](<xmalloc.c.md#xstrdup>)  (Implementation)


---
### xstrndup<!-- {{#callable_declaration:xstrndup}} -->
[View Source →](<../../xmalloc.h#L32>)

Duplicates a string up to a specified maximum length.
- **Description**: Use this function to create a duplicate of a string with a specified maximum length. It is useful when you need to ensure that the copied string does not exceed a certain size. The function will terminate the program if memory allocation fails, so it is important to use it in contexts where such behavior is acceptable. This function is part of a set of memory allocation functions that do not return on failure, making it suitable for applications where reliability is critical.
- **Inputs**:
    - `str`: The source string to duplicate. Must not be null. The caller retains ownership of the original string.
    - `maxlen`: The maximum number of characters to duplicate from the source string. Must be a non-negative value.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the newly allocated string, which is a duplicate of the source string up to the specified maximum length. The caller is responsible for freeing the allocated memory.
- **See Also**: [`xstrndup`](<xmalloc.c.md#xstrndup>)  (Implementation)

### xasprintf<!-- {{#callable_declaration:xasprintf}} -->
[View Source →](<../../xmalloc.h#L33>)

Formats a string and allocates memory for it.
- **Description**: Use this function to format a string according to a specified format and store the result in a newly allocated memory buffer. It is useful when you need a formatted string but do not know the required buffer size in advance. The function allocates sufficient memory to hold the formatted string and assigns the pointer to this memory to the provided pointer variable. It must be called with a valid format string and a pointer to a character pointer. The function does not return on memory allocation failure, as it is designed to handle such errors internally.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ret`: A pointer to a character pointer where the function will store the address of the newly allocated buffer containing the formatted string. Must not be null. The caller is responsible for freeing the allocated memory.
    - `fmt`: A format string that specifies how to format the subsequent arguments. Must not be null. The format string follows the same specifications as the standard printf function.
    - `...`: A variable number of arguments that are formatted according to the format string. The number and types of these arguments must match the format specifiers in the format string.
- **Output**: Returns the number of characters printed, excluding the null byte used to end output to strings. If memory allocation fails, the function does not return.
- **See Also**: [`xasprintf`](<xmalloc.c.md#xasprintf>)  (Implementation)

### xvasprintf<!-- {{#callable_declaration:xvasprintf}} -->
[View Source →](<../../xmalloc.h#L36>)

Formats a string and allocates memory for it.
- **Description**: Use this function to format a string with variable arguments and allocate memory for the resulting string. It is similar to `vasprintf`, but it will terminate the program if memory allocation fails. This function is useful when you want to ensure that the program does not continue execution in the event of a memory allocation error. The function must be called with a valid format string and a `va_list` of arguments.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ret`: A pointer to a `char*` where the function will store the address of the allocated string. The pointer must not be null, and the caller is responsible for freeing the allocated memory.
    - `fmt`: A format string that specifies how to format the output. It must not be null and should follow the same rules as the format string in `printf`.
    - `ap`: A `va_list` of arguments to format according to the format string. It must be initialized before calling this function.
- **Output**: Returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings) or terminates the program if memory allocation fails.
- **See Also**: [`xvasprintf`](<xmalloc.c.md#xvasprintf>)  (Implementation)


---
### xsnprintf<!-- {{#callable_declaration:xsnprintf}} -->
[View Source →](<../../xmalloc.h#L39>)

Formats and stores a series of characters and values in a buffer.
- **Description**: Use this function to format a string and store it in a buffer, ensuring that the output does not exceed the specified buffer length. It is similar to `snprintf` but includes additional safety checks. The function must be called with a valid format string and the corresponding arguments. It is important to ensure that the buffer is large enough to hold the formatted string to avoid truncation. The function returns the number of characters that would have been written if the buffer had been sufficiently large, not counting the terminating null byte. This means that if the return value is greater than or equal to the buffer length, the output was truncated.
- **Inputs**:
    - `str`: A pointer to the buffer where the formatted string will be stored. Must not be null, and the caller must ensure it points to a valid memory area of at least 'len' bytes.
    - `len`: The maximum number of bytes to write to the buffer, including the null terminator. Must be a positive value.
    - `fmt`: A format string that specifies how to format the subsequent arguments. Must not be null and must be a valid format string.
- **Output**: Returns the number of characters that would have been written if the buffer had been sufficiently large, not including the terminating null byte. If the return value is greater than or equal to 'len', the output was truncated.
- **See Also**: [`xsnprintf`](<xmalloc.c.md#xsnprintf>)  (Implementation)


---
### xvsnprintf<!-- {{#callable_declaration:xvsnprintf}} -->
[View Source →](<../../xmalloc.h#L43>)

Formats a string with variable arguments into a buffer.
- **Description**: Use this function to format a string with a variable argument list and store the result in a buffer. It is important to ensure that the buffer length does not exceed `INT_MAX`, as the function will terminate the program if this condition is violated. The function also terminates the program if the formatted string length is greater than or equal to the buffer length, preventing buffer overflow. This function is useful when you need to format strings safely with a variable argument list, ensuring that the buffer is not overrun.
- **Inputs**:
    - `str`: A pointer to the buffer where the formatted string will be stored. The buffer must be large enough to hold the resulting string, including the null terminator.
    - `len`: The size of the buffer `str`. Must not exceed `INT_MAX`. If this condition is violated, the function will terminate the program.
    - `fmt`: A format string that specifies how to format the variable arguments. Must not be null.
    - `ap`: A `va_list` containing the variable arguments to format according to `fmt`. The caller must initialize this list before passing it to the function.
- **Output**: Returns the number of characters written, excluding the null terminator. If the return value is negative or greater than or equal to `len`, the function will terminate the program.
- **See Also**: [`xvsnprintf`](<xmalloc.c.md#xvsnprintf>)  (Implementation)
