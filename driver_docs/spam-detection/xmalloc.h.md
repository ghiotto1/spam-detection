Memory allocation functions that check results and call fatal on error.

# Purpose
This C header file, `xmalloc.h`, defines a set of memory allocation and string manipulation functions that enhance standard library functions by incorporating error checking. The functions [`xmalloc`](<#xmalloc>), [`xcalloc`](<#xcalloc>), [`xrealloc`](<#xrealloc>), [`xreallocarray`](<#xreallocarray>), and [`xrecallocarray`](<#xrecallocarray>) are designed to allocate memory and will call a fatal error handler if allocation fails, ensuring that they never return a null pointer. Additionally, [`xstrdup`](<#xstrdup>) and [`xstrndup`](<#xstrndup>) are used for duplicating strings with similar error handling. The file also includes formatted output functions [`xasprintf`](<#xasprintf>), [`xvasprintf`](<#xvasprintf>), [`xsnprintf`](<#xsnprintf>), and [`xvsnprintf`](<#xvsnprintf>), which provide safer alternatives to their standard counterparts by checking for errors and ensuring non-null format strings. The header uses preprocessor directives to prevent multiple inclusions and defines a macro `__bounded__` for compatibility with systems that do not support it.
# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### xmalloc<!-- {{#callable_declaration:xmalloc}} -->
[View Source →](<../../xmalloc.h#L26>)

Allocates memory and checks for allocation success.
- **Description**: Use this function to allocate a specified amount of memory. It ensures that the allocation is successful by terminating the program if the allocation fails or if the requested size is zero. This function is useful in scenarios where memory allocation failure is considered a critical error and should not be handled by the caller.
- **Inputs**:
    - `size`: Specifies the number of bytes to allocate. Must be greater than zero. If zero, the function will terminate the program.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the allocated memory block. The program terminates if allocation fails.
- **See Also**: [`xmalloc`](<xmalloc.c.md#xmalloc>)  (Implementation)


---
### xcalloc<!-- {{#callable_declaration:xcalloc}} -->
[View Source →](<../../xmalloc.h#L27>)

Allocates memory for an array and checks for allocation errors.
- **Description**: Use this function to allocate memory for an array of elements, where each element has a specified size. It ensures that the allocation is successful by terminating the program if the allocation fails or if either dimension is zero. This function is useful when you want to ensure that memory allocation errors are handled immediately and do not propagate through the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `nmemb`: The number of elements to allocate. Must be greater than zero. If zero, the function will terminate the program.
    - `size`: The size of each element in bytes. Must be greater than zero. If zero, the function will terminate the program.
- **Output**: A pointer to the allocated memory block. The program terminates if allocation fails.
- **See Also**: [`xcalloc`](<xmalloc.c.md#xcalloc>)  (Implementation)


---
### xrealloc<!-- {{#callable_declaration:xrealloc}} -->
[View Source →](<../../xmalloc.h#L28>)

Reallocates memory to a new size.
- **Description**: Use this function to change the size of a previously allocated memory block. It is useful when you need to expand or shrink the memory block pointed to by `ptr`. The function does not return on failure; instead, it terminates the program. This behavior ensures that the caller does not need to check for null pointers after calling this function. Ensure that `ptr` is a valid pointer obtained from a previous memory allocation function or is null.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ptr`: A pointer to the memory block to reallocate. It must be a valid pointer obtained from a previous allocation function or null.
    - `size`: The new size for the memory block in bytes. It must be a non-zero value.
- **Output**: A pointer to the reallocated memory block, which may be at a different location.
- **See Also**: [`xrealloc`](<xmalloc.c.md#xrealloc>)  (Implementation)


---
### xreallocarray<!-- {{#callable_declaration:xreallocarray}} -->
[View Source →](<../../xmalloc.h#L29>)

Reallocates memory for an array with error checking.
- **Description**: Use this function to resize an existing memory block for an array, ensuring that the operation does not fail silently. It is important to note that if either `nmemb` or `size` is zero, the function will terminate the program with an error message. Similarly, if the reallocation fails due to insufficient memory, the function will also terminate the program with an error message. This function is suitable for use cases where the program cannot continue without successfully reallocating memory.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ptr`: Pointer to the memory block to resize. Can be NULL, in which case the function behaves like `xmalloc`.
    - `nmemb`: Number of elements in the array. Must be greater than zero; otherwise, the function will terminate the program.
    - `size`: Size of each element in the array. Must be greater than zero; otherwise, the function will terminate the program.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the newly allocated memory block. The program terminates if the allocation fails.
- **See Also**: [`xreallocarray`](<xmalloc.c.md#xreallocarray>)  (Implementation)


---
### xrecallocarray<!-- {{#callable_declaration:xrecallocarray}} -->
[View Source →](<../../xmalloc.h#L30>)

Reallocates and zeroes memory for an array.
- **Description**: Use this function to resize an existing memory block for an array while ensuring that any newly allocated memory is zeroed. It is important to note that this function will not return on failure; instead, it will terminate the program. This function is suitable when you need to increase or decrease the size of an array and want to ensure that any new memory is initialized to zero. It must not be used with zero values for `nmemb` or `size`, as this will cause the program to terminate.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ptr`: Pointer to the existing memory block to resize. Can be NULL if no existing memory block is present.
    - `oldnmemb`: Number of elements in the existing memory block. Must be a valid size.
    - `nmemb`: New number of elements for the memory block. Must be greater than zero.
    - `size`: Size of each element in bytes. Must be greater than zero.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the newly allocated memory block, which is zeroed if it is larger than the original. The program terminates on allocation failure.
- **See Also**: [`xrecallocarray`](<xmalloc.c.md#xrecallocarray>)  (Implementation)


---
### xstrdup<!-- {{#callable_declaration:xstrdup}} -->
[View Source →](<../../xmalloc.h#L31>)

Duplicates a string with error handling.
- **Description**: Use this function to create a duplicate of a given string. It allocates memory for the new string and copies the content from the input string. If memory allocation fails, the function will terminate the program with an error message. This function is useful when you need a guaranteed successful string duplication without handling memory allocation errors manually.
- **Inputs**:
    - `str`: A pointer to a null-terminated string to duplicate. Must not be null. The caller retains ownership of the original string.
- **Output**: A pointer to the newly allocated duplicate string. The caller is responsible for freeing this memory.
- **See Also**: [`xstrdup`](<xmalloc.c.md#xstrdup>)  (Implementation)


---
### xstrndup<!-- {{#callable_declaration:xstrndup}} -->
[View Source →](<../../xmalloc.h#L32>)

Duplicates a string up to a specified maximum length.
- **Description**: Use this function to create a duplicate of a string with a specified maximum length. It is useful when you need to ensure that the copied string does not exceed a certain size. The function will terminate the program if memory allocation fails, so it is important to use it in contexts where such behavior is acceptable. This function is part of a set of memory allocation utilities that do not return on failure.
- **Inputs**:
    - `str`: The source string to duplicate. Must not be null, as the function does not handle null pointers.
    - `maxlen`: The maximum number of characters to duplicate from the source string. Must be a non-negative value.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the newly allocated string, which is a duplicate of the input string up to the specified maximum length. The caller is responsible for freeing the allocated memory.
- **See Also**: [`xstrndup`](<xmalloc.c.md#xstrndup>)  (Implementation)

### xasprintf<!-- {{#callable_declaration:xasprintf}} -->
[View Source →](<../../xmalloc.h#L33>)

Formats a string and allocates memory for it.
- **Description**: Use this function to format a string with a variable number of arguments and allocate memory for the resulting string. It is similar to `asprintf`, but it ensures that memory allocation does not fail by terminating the program if an error occurs. This function is useful when you need a formatted string and want to handle memory allocation automatically. Ensure that the format string is valid and that the function is called with the correct number of arguments corresponding to the format specifiers.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ret`: A pointer to a character pointer where the function will store the address of the newly allocated string. Must not be null. The caller is responsible for freeing the allocated memory.
    - `fmt`: A format string that specifies how to format the subsequent arguments. Must not be null and must be a valid format string.
    - `...`: A variable number of arguments that correspond to the format specifiers in `fmt`. The number and types of these arguments must match the format specifiers.
- **Output**: Returns the number of characters printed, excluding the null byte used to end output to strings. If memory allocation fails, the program will terminate.
- **See Also**: [`xasprintf`](<xmalloc.c.md#xasprintf>)  (Implementation)

### xvasprintf<!-- {{#callable_declaration:xvasprintf}} -->
[View Source →](<../../xmalloc.h#L36>)

Formats a string and allocates memory for it.
- **Description**: Use this function to format a string with variable arguments and allocate memory for the resulting string. It is similar to `vasprintf`, but it will terminate the program if memory allocation fails. This function is useful when you want to ensure that memory allocation errors do not occur silently. It must be called with a valid format string and a `va_list` of arguments. The caller is responsible for freeing the allocated memory.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ret`: A pointer to a `char*` where the function will store the address of the allocated string. Must not be null. The caller must free the allocated memory.
    - `fmt`: A format string that specifies how to format the output. Must not be null.
    - `ap`: A `va_list` of arguments to format according to the format string. Must be properly initialized before calling.
- **Output**: Returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte) or terminates the program if memory allocation fails.
- **See Also**: [`xvasprintf`](<xmalloc.c.md#xvasprintf>)  (Implementation)


---
### xsnprintf<!-- {{#callable_declaration:xsnprintf}} -->
[View Source →](<../../xmalloc.h#L39>)

Formats and stores a series of characters and values in a buffer.
- **Description**: Use this function to format a string and store it in a buffer, similar to `snprintf`. It takes a format string and a variable number of arguments, formats them according to the format string, and writes the result to the provided buffer. The function ensures that the buffer is not overflowed by limiting the number of characters written based on the specified buffer length. It is important to ensure that the format string is not null, as this is a precondition for using the function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `str`: A pointer to the buffer where the formatted string will be stored. The buffer must be large enough to hold the formatted string, including the null terminator. The function will not write more than 'len' characters to this buffer.
    - `len`: The maximum number of characters to write to the buffer, including the null terminator. Must be a positive value.
    - `fmt`: A format string that specifies how to format the subsequent arguments. Must not be null.
- **Output**: Returns the number of characters that would have been written if 'len' had been sufficiently large, not counting the terminating null character. If an error occurs, a negative value is returned.
- **See Also**: [`xsnprintf`](<xmalloc.c.md#xsnprintf>)  (Implementation)


---
### xvsnprintf<!-- {{#callable_declaration:xvsnprintf}} -->
[View Source →](<../../xmalloc.h#L43>)

Formats a string into a buffer using a variable argument list.
- **Description**: Use this function to format a string into a buffer with a specified maximum length, using a format string and a variable argument list. It is important to ensure that the buffer length does not exceed `INT_MAX`, as this will cause the function to terminate the program. The function will also terminate the program if the formatted string length is greater than or equal to the buffer length, preventing buffer overflow. This function is useful when you need to safely format strings with dynamic content.
- **Inputs**:
    - `str`: A pointer to the buffer where the formatted string will be stored. The buffer must be large enough to hold the formatted string and the null terminator. The caller retains ownership and must ensure it is not null.
    - `len`: The maximum number of bytes to write to the buffer, including the null terminator. Must not exceed `INT_MAX`. If it does, the function will terminate the program.
    - `fmt`: A format string that specifies how to format the variable arguments. Must not be null. The format string follows the same specifications as `printf`.
    - `ap`: A `va_list` containing the variable arguments to format according to the format string. The caller is responsible for initializing and managing the `va_list`.
- **Output**: Returns the number of characters that would have been written if the buffer had been sufficiently large, not counting the terminating null character. If the return value is negative or greater than or equal to `len`, the function will terminate the program.
- **See Also**: [`xvsnprintf`](<xmalloc.c.md#xvsnprintf>)  (Implementation)
