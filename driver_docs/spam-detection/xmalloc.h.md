Memory allocation functions that check results and call fatal on error.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that declares a set of memory management and string manipulation functions. These functions, such as [`xmalloc`](<#xmalloc>), [`xcalloc`](<#xcalloc>), [`xrealloc`](<#xrealloc>), and [`xstrdup`](<#xstrdup>), are designed to handle memory allocation and reallocation while ensuring that they do not return failure. Instead, they call a fatal error handler if an error occurs. The file also includes functions like [`xasprintf`](<#xasprintf>) and [`xvasprintf`](<#xvasprintf>) for formatted string operations, which include attributes to ensure proper usage and prevent common errors. The header uses conditional compilation to define the `__bounded__` macro if it is not already defined, ensuring compatibility across different environments.
# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### xmalloc<!-- {{#callable_declaration:xmalloc}} -->
[View Source →](<../../xmalloc.h#L26>)

Allocates memory and checks for allocation success.
- **Description**: Use this function to allocate a specified amount of memory. It ensures that the allocation is successful by terminating the program if the allocation fails or if the requested size is zero. This function is useful when you want to guarantee that memory allocation does not return a null pointer, thus avoiding the need for manual error checking after each allocation.
- **Inputs**:
    - `size`: The number of bytes to allocate. Must be greater than zero. If zero is provided, the function will terminate the program.
- **Output**: A pointer to the allocated memory block. The program will terminate if the allocation fails.
- **See Also**: [`xmalloc`](<xmalloc.c.md#xmalloc>)  (Implementation)


---
### xcalloc<!-- {{#callable_declaration:xcalloc}} -->
[View Source →](<../../xmalloc.h#L27>)

Allocates memory for an array and checks for allocation errors.
- **Description**: Use this function to allocate memory for an array with a specified number of elements and element size. It ensures that the allocation is successful by terminating the program if the allocation fails or if either parameter is zero. This function is useful when you want to ensure that memory allocation errors are handled immediately and do not propagate through the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `nmemb`: The number of elements to allocate. Must be greater than zero. If zero, the function will terminate the program.
    - `size`: The size of each element. Must be greater than zero. If zero, the function will terminate the program.
- **Output**: A pointer to the allocated memory block. The program terminates if allocation fails.
- **See Also**: [`xcalloc`](<xmalloc.c.md#xcalloc>)  (Implementation)


---
### xrealloc<!-- {{#callable_declaration:xrealloc}} -->
[View Source →](<../../xmalloc.h#L28>)

Reallocates memory for a given pointer to a new size.
- **Description**: Use this function to change the size of a previously allocated memory block. It is important to note that this function will not return a null pointer on failure; instead, it will terminate the program. This behavior ensures that the caller does not need to check for null pointers after calling this function. Ensure that the pointer provided was previously allocated by a compatible memory allocation function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ptr`: A pointer to the memory block to reallocate. Must not be null unless the intention is to allocate a new block. The pointer should have been obtained from a compatible memory allocation function.
    - `size`: The new size for the memory block in bytes. Must be greater than zero. If the size is zero, the behavior is undefined.
- **Output**: A pointer to the reallocated memory block, which may be at a different location than the original block.
- **See Also**: [`xrealloc`](<xmalloc.c.md#xrealloc>)  (Implementation)


---
### xreallocarray<!-- {{#callable_declaration:xreallocarray}} -->
[View Source →](<../../xmalloc.h#L29>)

Reallocates memory for an array with error checking.
- **Description**: Use this function to resize an existing memory block for an array, ensuring that the operation does not fail silently. It is important to provide non-zero values for both `nmemb` and `size`, as the function will terminate the program if either is zero. This function is useful when you need to safely increase or decrease the size of an allocated array without manually checking for allocation errors.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ptr`: Pointer to the memory block to resize. Can be NULL, in which case the function behaves like `xmalloc`.
    - `nmemb`: Number of elements in the array. Must be greater than zero.
    - `size`: Size of each element in the array. Must be greater than zero.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the newly allocated memory block. The program will terminate if memory allocation fails.
- **See Also**: [`xreallocarray`](<xmalloc.c.md#xreallocarray>)  (Implementation)


---
### xrecallocarray<!-- {{#callable_declaration:xrecallocarray}} -->
[View Source →](<../../xmalloc.h#L30>)

Reallocates memory for an array with error checking.
- **Description**: Use this function to resize an existing memory block for an array, ensuring that the operation does not fail silently. It is suitable when you need to change the number of elements or the size of each element in an array. The function will terminate the program if the allocation fails or if either the number of elements or the size of each element is zero. This behavior ensures that the caller does not need to handle memory allocation errors.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ptr`: Pointer to the existing memory block to be reallocated. Can be null if no existing memory block is present.
    - `oldnmemb`: Number of elements in the existing memory block. Must be a valid size_t value.
    - `nmemb`: New number of elements for the memory block. Must be greater than zero.
    - `size`: Size of each element in bytes. Must be greater than zero.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the newly allocated memory block. The program terminates if allocation fails.
- **See Also**: [`xrecallocarray`](<xmalloc.c.md#xrecallocarray>)  (Implementation)

### xstrdup<!-- {{#callable_declaration:xstrdup}} -->
[View Source →](<../../xmalloc.h#L31>)

Duplicates a string with error handling.
- **Description**: Use this function to create a duplicate of a given string. It allocates memory for the new string and copies the content from the input string. If memory allocation fails, the function will terminate the program with an error message. This function is useful when you need a guaranteed successful string duplication without handling memory allocation errors manually.
- **Inputs**:
    - `str`: A pointer to a null-terminated string to duplicate. Must not be null. The caller retains ownership of the original string.
- **Output**: A pointer to the newly allocated duplicate string. The caller is responsible for freeing this memory.
- **See Also**: [`xstrdup`](<xmalloc.c.md#xstrdup>)  (Implementation)


---
### xstrndup<!-- {{#callable_declaration:xstrndup}} -->
[View Source →](<../../xmalloc.h#L32>)

Duplicates a string up to a specified maximum length.
- **Description**: Use this function to create a duplicate of a string with a maximum length limit. It is useful when you need to ensure that the copied string does not exceed a certain size. The function will terminate the program if memory allocation fails, so it is important to use it in contexts where such behavior is acceptable. This function is part of a set of memory allocation utilities that do not return on failure.
- **Inputs**:
    - `str`: The input string to duplicate. Must not be null, as the function does not handle null pointers.
    - `maxlen`: The maximum number of characters to duplicate from the input string. Must be a non-negative value.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the newly allocated string, which is a duplicate of the input string up to the specified maximum length. The caller is responsible for freeing the allocated memory.
- **See Also**: [`xstrndup`](<xmalloc.c.md#xstrndup>)  (Implementation)

### xasprintf<!-- {{#callable_declaration:xasprintf}} -->
[View Source →](<../../xmalloc.h#L33>)

Formats a string and allocates memory for it.
- **Description**: Use this function to format a string according to a specified format and store the result in a newly allocated memory buffer. It is useful when you need a formatted string but do not know the required buffer size in advance. The function allocates memory for the resulting string and assigns the pointer to the provided location. It never returns a failure; instead, it calls a fatal error handler if memory allocation fails. Ensure that the format string is valid and that the function is called with the correct number of arguments corresponding to the format specifiers.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ret`: A pointer to a char pointer where the function will store the address of the newly allocated string. Must not be null. The caller is responsible for freeing the allocated memory.
    - `fmt`: A format string that specifies how to format the output. Must not be null. The format string follows the same specifications as printf.
    - `...`: Additional arguments that correspond to the format specifiers in the format string. The number and types of these arguments must match the format specifiers.
- **Output**: Returns the number of characters in the formatted string, excluding the null terminator.
- **See Also**: [`xasprintf`](<xmalloc.c.md#xasprintf>)  (Implementation)


---
### xvasprintf<!-- {{#callable_declaration:xvasprintf}} -->
[View Source →](<../../xmalloc.h#L36>)

Formats a string and allocates memory for it, ensuring no failure occurs.
- **Description**: Use this function to format a string with variable arguments and allocate memory for the resulting string. It is similar to `vasprintf`, but it ensures that the operation does not fail by terminating the program if an error occurs. This function is useful when you want to guarantee that memory allocation and string formatting succeed without handling errors manually. Ensure that the format string is valid and that the variable argument list corresponds to the format specifiers.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ret`: A pointer to a `char*` where the function will store the address of the allocated string. Must not be null. The caller is responsible for freeing the allocated memory.
    - `fmt`: A format string that specifies how to format the variable arguments. Must not be null.
    - `ap`: A `va_list` containing the variable arguments to format according to the format string. Must be properly initialized before calling.
- **Output**: Returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings). If an error occurs, the function terminates the program.
- **See Also**: [`xvasprintf`](<xmalloc.c.md#xvasprintf>)  (Implementation)


---
### xsnprintf<!-- {{#callable_declaration:xsnprintf}} -->
[View Source →](<../../xmalloc.h#L39>)

Formats and stores a string in a buffer with size checking.
- **Description**: Use this function to format a string according to a specified format and store it in a provided buffer. It is important to ensure that the buffer is large enough to hold the resulting string, including the null terminator. The function will not write more than the specified number of bytes to the buffer, preventing buffer overflow. This function must be called with a valid format string and the corresponding arguments. It returns the number of characters that would have been written if the buffer had been sufficiently large, not counting the terminating null byte. This can be used to detect truncation.
- **Inputs**:
    - `str`: A pointer to the buffer where the formatted string will be stored. Must not be null, and the caller must ensure it points to a valid memory area of at least 'len' bytes.
    - `len`: The maximum number of bytes to write to the buffer, including the null terminator. Must be a positive number.
    - `fmt`: A format string that specifies how to format the subsequent arguments. Must not be null and must be a valid format string.
    - `...`: A variable number of arguments that correspond to the format specifiers in 'fmt'. The number and types of these arguments must match the format string.
- **Output**: Returns the number of characters that would have been written if 'len' had been sufficiently large, not including the terminating null byte. A return value of 'len' or more means that the output was truncated.
- **See Also**: [`xsnprintf`](<xmalloc.c.md#xsnprintf>)  (Implementation)


---
### xvsnprintf<!-- {{#callable_declaration:xvsnprintf}} -->
[View Source →](<../../xmalloc.h#L43>)

Formats a string into a buffer using a variable argument list.
- **Description**: Use this function to format a string into a buffer with a specified maximum length, using a format string and a variable argument list. It is important to ensure that the `len` parameter does not exceed `INT_MAX`, as this will cause the function to terminate the program. The function will also terminate the program if the formatted string length exceeds the buffer size. This function is useful when you need to safely format strings without risking buffer overflows.
- **Inputs**:
    - `str`: A pointer to the buffer where the formatted string will be stored. The buffer must be large enough to hold the formatted string and the null terminator. The caller retains ownership.
    - `len`: The maximum number of bytes to write to the buffer, including the null terminator. Must not exceed `INT_MAX`. If it does, the function will terminate the program.
    - `fmt`: A format string that specifies how to format the variable arguments. Must not be null.
    - `ap`: A `va_list` containing the variable arguments to format according to the format string. The caller is responsible for initializing and cleaning up the `va_list`.
- **Output**: Returns the number of characters that would have been written if `len` had been sufficiently large, not counting the terminating null character. If the return value is negative or greater than or equal to `len`, the function will terminate the program.
- **See Also**: [`xvsnprintf`](<xmalloc.c.md#xvsnprintf>)  (Implementation)
