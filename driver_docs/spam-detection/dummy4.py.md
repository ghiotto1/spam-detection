Prints multiple lines of text to the console.

# Purpose
This code is a simple script that outputs text to the console. It uses the `print` function to display a series of messages, starting with "new file 4" followed by five identical lines of "another new line". The script demonstrates basic usage of the `print` function in Python to produce output. There are no variables, functions, or complex logic involved, indicating that the script provides narrow functionality focused solely on printing text.
