Prints multiple lines of text to the console.

# Purpose
This script outputs a series of text lines to the console. It uses the `print` function to display the string "new file 4" followed by multiple repetitions of the string "another new line." The script demonstrates basic usage of the `print` function in Python to produce output. The functionality is narrow, focusing solely on printing predefined text to the standard output.
