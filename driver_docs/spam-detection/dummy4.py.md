The `dummy4.py` file in the `spam-detection` codebase contains simple print statements for testing or placeholder purposes.

# Purpose
This code is a short script that provides very narrow functionality, primarily for outputting text to the console. It consists of two `print` statements that display the strings "new file 4" and "new file again" when executed. The script appears to be used for simple testing or demonstration purposes, possibly to verify that a new file or script is being executed correctly. There are no variables, functions, or complex logic involved, indicating its simplicity and limited scope.
