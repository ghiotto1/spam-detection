Prints multiple lines of text to the console.

# Purpose
This script outputs a series of messages to the console. It uses the `print` function to display the text "new file 4" followed by four identical lines of "another new line". The script demonstrates basic usage of the `print` function in Python to produce output. The functionality is narrow, focusing solely on printing predefined strings.
