Prints "new file 4".

# Purpose
This code is a simple script that outputs the string "new file 4" to the standard output. It uses the `print` function to display the message. The script provides narrow functionality, serving primarily as a placeholder or a basic test to confirm that the Python environment is functioning correctly.
