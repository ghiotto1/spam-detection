The `dummy4.py` file in the `spam-detection` codebase contains a simple print statement that outputs "new file 4".

# Purpose
This code is a simple script that outputs the string "new file 4" to the console. It provides very narrow functionality, serving primarily as a placeholder or a basic test to ensure that the Python environment is set up correctly and can execute a script. The script does not perform any complex operations or computations and does not include any variables, functions, or external dependencies. Its simplicity suggests it might be used for demonstration purposes or as a starting point for further development.
