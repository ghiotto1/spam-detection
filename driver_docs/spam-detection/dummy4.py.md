Prints several lines of text to the console.

# Purpose
This script outputs a series of text lines to the console. It uses the `print` function to display the strings "new file 4" and "another new line" multiple times. The script demonstrates basic usage of the `print` function in Python to produce console output. The functionality is narrow, focusing solely on printing predefined text.
