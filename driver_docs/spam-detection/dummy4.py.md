Prints multiple lines of text to the console.

# Purpose
This script outputs a series of text lines to the console. It uses the `print` function to display the string "new file 4" followed by the string "another new line" multiple times. The script demonstrates basic usage of the `print` function in Python to produce output. The repeated lines suggest a focus on generating consistent output, possibly for testing or demonstration purposes.
