Prints three lines of text to the console.

# Purpose
This code is a simple script that outputs three lines of text to the console. It uses the `print` function to display the strings "new file 4", "another new line", and 'another new line'. The script demonstrates basic usage of the `print` function in Python to produce output. The use of both double and single quotes for string literals shows that Python supports both for defining strings. This script provides narrow functionality, primarily for testing or demonstration purposes.
