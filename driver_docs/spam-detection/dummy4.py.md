The `dummy4.py` file in the `spam-detection` codebase contains a simple print statement that outputs "new file 4".

# Purpose
This code is a simple script that outputs the string "new file 4" to the console. It provides very narrow functionality, serving primarily as a placeholder or a basic test to ensure that the Python environment is set up correctly and can execute a script. The script does not perform any complex operations or computations, nor does it include any variables, functions, or external dependencies. Its primary purpose is likely to verify that a new file has been created and can be executed without errors.
