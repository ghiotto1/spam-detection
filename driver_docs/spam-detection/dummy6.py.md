Prints "A sixth new file".

# Purpose
This code is a simple script that outputs the string "A sixth new file" to the standard output. It provides narrow functionality, as it only performs a single print operation. This type of code is typically used for testing, demonstration, or logging purposes to confirm that a specific part of a program is executing.
