An interface for a scheduler that extends Runnable and AutoCloseable.

# Purpose
The `Scheduler` interface defines a contract for scheduling components in the `io.kestra.core.schedulers` package. It extends both `Runnable` and `AutoCloseable`, indicating that any implementing class must provide implementations for the `run` method and the `close` method. The `@Singleton` annotation suggests that the implementing class should be instantiated as a single instance within the application context. This interface provides narrow functionality by specifying a structure for schedulers that can be executed and closed, ensuring resource management and task execution capabilities.
