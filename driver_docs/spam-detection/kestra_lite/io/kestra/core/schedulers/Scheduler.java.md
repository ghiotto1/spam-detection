An interface for a scheduler that is runnable and auto-closeable.

# Purpose
The `Scheduler` interface defines a contract for scheduling components in the `io.kestra.core.schedulers` package. It extends both `Runnable` and `AutoCloseable`, indicating that any implementing class must provide implementations for the `run` method and the `close` method. This interface provides narrow functionality by specifying that a scheduler must be capable of being executed as a thread and must support resource management through closure. The use of the `@Singleton` annotation suggests that implementations of this interface are intended to be instantiated as a single instance within the application context.

- **Description**: Represents a contract for scheduling tasks, ensuring that the implementing class can be executed as a thread and can be closed when no longer needed. The `Scheduler` interface extends both `Runnable` and `AutoCloseable`, which means that any class implementing this interface must provide implementations for the `run` method from `Runnable` and the `close` method from `AutoCloseable`. The `@Singleton` annotation indicates that there should be only one instance of the implementing class in the application context.
- **Extends/Implements**:
    - `Runnable`
    - `AutoCloseable`
