An interface for a scheduler that extends Runnable and AutoCloseable.

# Purpose
The `Scheduler` interface defines a contract for scheduling components in the `io.kestra.core.schedulers` package. It extends both `Runnable` and `AutoCloseable`, indicating that any implementing class must provide implementations for the `run` method and the `close` method. The `@Singleton` annotation suggests that there should be only one instance of any implementing class within the application context. This interface provides narrow functionality by specifying a structure for schedulers that can be executed and closed, ensuring resource management and task execution capabilities.

- **Description**: Provides a contract for scheduling tasks, ensuring that implementations can be executed as a thread and can be closed when no longer needed. The `Scheduler` interface extends both `Runnable` and `AutoCloseable`, which means that any class implementing `Scheduler` must provide implementations for the `run` method from `Runnable` and the `close` method from `AutoCloseable`. This allows for the execution of tasks in a separate thread and ensures that resources can be released when the scheduler is closed.
- **Extends/Implements**:
    - `Runnable`
    - `AutoCloseable`
