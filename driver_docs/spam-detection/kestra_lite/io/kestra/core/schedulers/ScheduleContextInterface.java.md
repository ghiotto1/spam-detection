An empty interface for scheduling context in the `io.kestra.core.schedulers` package.

# Purpose
The `ScheduleContextInterface` is a Java interface within the `io.kestra.core.schedulers` package. It defines a contract for classes that implement it, but it does not specify any methods or fields. This interface provides narrow functionality as it serves as a marker or a placeholder for future development or for use in type hierarchies. It can be used to enforce a type or to provide a common parent for multiple classes within the scheduling context of the application.

- **Description**: `ScheduleContextInterface` is an interface defined in the `io.kestra.core.schedulers` package. It serves as a marker interface, which means it does not declare any methods or fields. Marker interfaces are used to convey metadata about a class implementing the interface, often to indicate that the class has a particular property or should be processed in a certain way by the framework or application.
