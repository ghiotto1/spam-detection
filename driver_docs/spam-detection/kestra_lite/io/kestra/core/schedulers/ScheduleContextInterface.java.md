An empty interface for scheduling context in the `io.kestra.core.schedulers` package.

# Purpose
The `ScheduleContextInterface` is a Java interface within the `io.kestra.core.schedulers` package. It defines a contract for classes that implement it, but it does not specify any methods or fields. This interface provides narrow functionality as it serves as a marker or a placeholder for future extensions or implementations related to scheduling contexts. Implementing classes can use this interface to indicate that they belong to a specific type or category within the scheduling framework.
