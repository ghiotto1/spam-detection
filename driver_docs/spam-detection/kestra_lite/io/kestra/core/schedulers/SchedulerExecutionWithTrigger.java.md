Defines a scheduler execution with an associated trigger context.

# Purpose
The `SchedulerExecutionWithTrigger` class encapsulates the relationship between an `Execution` and a `TriggerContext`. It provides a structured way to associate an execution instance with its corresponding trigger context. The class uses Lombok annotations `@AllArgsConstructor` and `@Getter` to automatically generate a constructor with all fields and getter methods for each field. This class is part of the `io.kestra.core.schedulers` package, indicating its role in scheduling operations within the application. The functionality is narrow, focusing on the specific task of linking execution data with trigger context information.
