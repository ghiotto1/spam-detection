Defines a scheduler execution with trigger context using Execution and TriggerContext models.

# Purpose
The `SchedulerExecutionWithTrigger` class encapsulates the relationship between an `Execution` and a `TriggerContext` within a scheduling system. It uses Lombok annotations `@AllArgsConstructor` and `@Getter` to automatically generate a constructor and getter methods for its fields. The class provides narrow functionality by serving as a data container that holds an `Execution` object and a `TriggerContext` object, which are essential for managing and tracking scheduled tasks and their triggers. This class is part of the `io.kestra.core.schedulers` package, indicating its role in the core scheduling operations of the application.
