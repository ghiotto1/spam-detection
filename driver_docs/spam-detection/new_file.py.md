Prints a message indicating it is a new Python file.

# Purpose
This code is a simple Python script that prints a message to the console. The message is 'this is a new python file, cool'. Note that there is a syntax error in the code due to mismatched quotation marks. The opening quotation mark is a single quote, while the closing quotation mark is a double quote. To correct this, both quotation marks should be either single or double quotes.
