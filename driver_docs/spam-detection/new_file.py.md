Prints a message and uses TestClass to print a test string.

# Purpose
This script demonstrates the instantiation and use of a class from an external module. It first prints the message "adding a new file" to the console. Then, it imports the `TestClass` from the `test.py` module. An instance of `TestClass` is created and its method `print_test_str` is called with the argument "hello there", which likely prints or processes this string in some way. This script provides narrow functionality, primarily focusing on demonstrating the use of `TestClass` and its method.
