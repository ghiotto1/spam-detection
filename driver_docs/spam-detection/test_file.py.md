Prints 'this is a test_file'.

# Purpose
This code is a simple script that outputs the string `'this is a test_file'` to the standard output. It demonstrates basic usage of the `print` function in Python to display text. The script does not take any input or perform any additional operations. It serves as a basic example or placeholder for testing the execution of Python scripts.
