Prints a message indicating the creation of a new file.

# Purpose
This code is a simple script that outputs the message "making a new file" to the standard output. It uses the `print` function to display this message. The script does not perform any other operations or include any additional logic. It serves a narrow purpose of providing a textual notification, possibly as part of a larger process where a new file is being created.
