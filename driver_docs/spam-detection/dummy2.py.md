The `dummy2.py` file in the `spam-detection` codebase contains a simple print statement that outputs "this is a different new file".

# Purpose
This code is a short script that outputs a single line of text to the console. It provides very narrow functionality, as its sole purpose is to print the string "this is a different new file" when executed. This type of script is often used for testing or demonstration purposes, such as verifying that a Python environment is set up correctly or serving as a placeholder for more complex functionality to be added later. The simplicity of the code suggests it is not intended for production use but rather for basic output or educational purposes.
