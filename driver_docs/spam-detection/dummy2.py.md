Prints a message indicating it is a different new file.

# Purpose
This code is a simple script that outputs the string "this is a different new file" to the standard output. It uses the `print` function to display the message on the console. The script does not take any input or perform any additional operations. It serves the narrow purpose of demonstrating or confirming the execution of a Python script by printing a specific message.
