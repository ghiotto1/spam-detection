The `dummy3.py` file in the `spam-detection` codebase contains a single print statement that outputs the text 'new file'.

# Purpose
This code is a very simple script that outputs the string "new file" to the console. It provides extremely narrow functionality, serving primarily as a placeholder or a basic test to ensure that a Python environment is set up correctly and can execute scripts. The script does not perform any complex operations or computations, nor does it accept input or produce variable output. It is likely used as a starting point for further development or as a minimal example to verify that the Python interpreter is functioning as expected.
