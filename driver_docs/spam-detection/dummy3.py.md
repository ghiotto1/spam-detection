Prints 'new file'.

# Purpose
This code is a simple script that outputs the string `'new file'` to the standard output. It uses the `print` function, which is a built-in function in Python, to display the specified text. The script provides narrow functionality, as it performs a single action of printing a message. This type of code is often used for testing or as a placeholder in a larger program.
