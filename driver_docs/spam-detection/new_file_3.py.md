Prints a message indicating the presence of new files.

# Purpose
This code is a simple script that outputs a message to the console. It uses the `print` function to display the string "more new files!! the best". The script does not take any input or perform any other operations. It is likely intended for demonstration or testing purposes to verify that the print functionality is working as expected.
