The `xmalloc.c` file in the `spam-detection` codebase provides custom memory allocation functions that ensure successful memory allocation by terminating the program with an error message if allocation fails.

# Purpose
This C source code file provides a set of memory allocation and string manipulation functions that enhance standard library functions by incorporating error checking and handling. The functions defined in this file, such as [`xmalloc`](<#xmalloc>), [`xcalloc`](<#xcalloc>), [`xrealloc`](<#xrealloc>), and [`xstrdup`](<#xstrdup>), are designed to ensure that memory allocation operations do not fail silently. Instead of returning `NULL` on failure, these functions call a `fatalx` function, which is presumably defined elsewhere, to handle errors in a more controlled manner. This approach ensures that any issues with memory allocation are immediately addressed, preventing potential undefined behavior or crashes due to unhandled `NULL` pointers.

The file also includes functions for formatted string operations, such as [`xasprintf`](<#xasprintf>) and [`xsnprintf`](<#xsnprintf>), which similarly incorporate error checking to prevent buffer overflows and other common pitfalls associated with string formatting in C. By wrapping standard functions like `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, `strdup`, and `snprintf`, this file provides a robust interface for memory and string operations, enhancing the reliability and safety of the code that utilizes these functions. The inclusion of these functions suggests that the file is part of a larger codebase, likely intended to be used as a utility library within a project, ensuring consistent error handling across various components.

### xmalloc<!-- {{#callable:xmalloc}} -->
The `xmalloc` function allocates memory of a specified size and terminates the program if the allocation fails or if the requested size is zero.
- **Inputs**:
    - `size`: The number of bytes to allocate.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the requested size is zero; if so, call `fatalx` to terminate the program with an error message.
    - Attempt to allocate memory using `malloc` with the specified size.
    - Check if the memory allocation failed (i.e., `malloc` returned NULL); if so, call `fatalx` to terminate the program with an error message including the error string from `strerror(errno)`.
    - Return the pointer to the allocated memory.
- **Output**: A pointer to the allocated memory block, or the program is terminated if allocation fails or size is zero.


---
### xcalloc<!-- {{#callable:xcalloc}} -->
The `xcalloc` function allocates memory for an array of elements, ensuring that the allocation is successful and aborting the program if it fails.

    - `nmemb`: The number of elements to allocate memory for.
    - `size`: The size of each element to allocate.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if either 'nmemb' or 'size' is zero; if so, call 'fatalx' to terminate the program with an error message.
    - Attempt to allocate memory using 'calloc' for 'nmemb' elements each of 'size' bytes.
    - If 'calloc' returns NULL, indicating a failure to allocate memory, call 'fatalx' to terminate the program with an error message including the error details.
    - Return the pointer to the allocated memory.
- **Output**: A pointer to the allocated memory block, or the program is terminated if allocation fails.
