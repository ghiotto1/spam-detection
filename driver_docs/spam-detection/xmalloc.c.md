The `xmalloc.c` file in the `spam-detection` codebase provides custom memory allocation functions that ensure successful memory allocation by terminating the program with an error message if allocation fails.

# Purpose
This C source code file provides a set of memory allocation and string manipulation functions that enhance the standard C library functions by incorporating error checking and handling. The functions defined in this file, such as [`xmalloc`](#xmalloc), [`xcalloc`](#xcalloc), [`xrealloc`](#xrealloc), and [`xstrdup`](#xstrdup), are designed to ensure that memory allocation operations do not fail silently. Instead of returning `NULL` on failure, these functions call a `fatalx` function, which is presumably defined elsewhere, to handle errors in a more controlled manner. This approach prevents the program from continuing execution with invalid memory pointers, thereby enhancing robustness and reliability.

The file is part of a larger project, as indicated by the inclusion of "tmux.h", suggesting it is likely a component of the tmux terminal multiplexer. The functions provided are not intended to be standalone but are meant to be integrated into a larger codebase, offering a safer alternative to standard memory and string handling functions. The file does not define a public API or external interface but rather serves as an internal utility to ensure that memory operations within the project are handled safely and consistently. The use of these functions can help prevent common programming errors related to memory management, such as buffer overflows and memory leaks.

# Functions

---
### xmalloc<!-- {{#callable:xmalloc}} -->
The `xmalloc` function allocates memory of a specified size and terminates the program if the allocation fails or if the requested size is zero.
- **Inputs**:
    - `size`: The number of bytes to allocate.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the requested size is zero; if so, call `fatalx` to terminate the program with an error message.
    - Attempt to allocate memory using `malloc` with the specified size.
    - Check if the allocation was successful; if not, call `fatalx` to terminate the program with an error message including the size and error description.
    - Return the pointer to the allocated memory.
- **Output**: A pointer to the allocated memory block, or the program is terminated if allocation fails.


---
### xcalloc<!-- {{#callable:xcalloc}} -->
The `xcalloc` function allocates memory for an array of elements, ensuring that the allocation is successful and aborting the program if it fails.
- **Inputs**:
    - `nmemb`: The number of elements to allocate memory for.
    - `size`: The size of each element to allocate.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if either `nmemb` or `size` is zero; if so, call `fatalx` to terminate the program with an error message.
    - Attempt to allocate memory using `calloc` for `nmemb` elements each of `size` bytes.
    - If `calloc` returns `NULL`, indicating a failure to allocate memory, call `fatalx` to terminate the program with an error message including the number of bytes requested and the error string from `strerror(errno)`.
    - Return the pointer to the allocated memory.
- **Output**: A pointer to the allocated memory block, or the program is terminated if allocation fails.


---
