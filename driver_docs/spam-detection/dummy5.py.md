Prints a message indicating a new file is added.

# Purpose
This code is a simple script that outputs the message "added a new file" to the standard output. It uses the `print` function to display this message, which can be useful for logging or indicating that a new file has been created or added in a larger process. The script provides narrow functionality, focusing solely on the task of printing a specific message.
