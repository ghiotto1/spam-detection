Testing functions for various components of a Chess implementation in C, including moves and board states.

# Purpose
This header file defines function prototypes for testing various components of a Chess implementation in C. It includes functions to test the creation and manipulation of chess squares, moves, move lists, and boards. The file also contains functions to validate specific chess rules, such as checking if a square is attacked or if a board position is in check. Additionally, it provides functions to test the generation of moves, including special moves like castling, and the conversion of board states to and from the FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) format. The [`failTest`](<#failtest>) function is used to fail a test and halt the program, optionally displaying a message.
# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### failTest<!-- {{#callable_declaration:failTest}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../chesslib/src/tests.h#L9>)

Fails the current test and stops the program.
- **Description**: Use this function to indicate a test failure and terminate the program immediately. It is useful in test scenarios where continuing execution after a failure is not desired. The function can optionally take a message to provide additional context about the failure. If the message is `NULL`, only the test name is printed. This function does not return, as it calls `exit(1)` to stop the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `msg`: A pointer to a null-terminated string that contains a message to display with the failure notice. If `NULL`, no additional message is displayed. The caller retains ownership of the string.
- **Output**: None
- **See Also**: [`failTest`](<tests.c.md#failtest>)  (Implementation)


---
### validateString<!-- {{#callable_declaration:validateString}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../chesslib/src/tests.h#L10>)

Compares two strings and fails the test if they are not equal.
- **Description**: Use this function to compare two strings during a test. If the strings are not equal, the function calls `failTest` with a message indicating the actual and expected strings, and then halts the program. This function is useful for validating string outputs in test cases. Ensure that both input strings are valid, null-terminated C strings.
- **Inputs**:
    - `actual`: The string to compare against the expected value. Must be a valid, null-terminated C string. Caller retains ownership.
