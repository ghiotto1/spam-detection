Testing functions for various chess components, including moves, boards, and FEN generation.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines function prototypes for testing various components of a chess implementation. It includes functions to test different aspects of the chess game, such as square operations, move creation and validation, move lists, board setup and comparison, and piece-specific move generation. The file also contains functions to test the detection of square attacks, check conditions, move playing, full move generation, FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) generation, and draw conditions due to insufficient material. The [`failTest`](<#failtest>) function is used to fail a test and halt the program, optionally displaying a message. This header file is intended to be included in a test suite to ensure the correctness of the chess implementation.
# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### failTest<!-- {{#callable_declaration:failTest}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../chesslib/src/tests.h#L9>)

Fails the current test and stops the program.
- **Description**: Use this function to indicate a test failure and terminate the program immediately. It is useful in test scenarios where continuing execution after a failure is not desired. The function can output an optional message to provide additional context about the failure. If no message is provided, it will only indicate the test name.
- **Inputs**:
    - `msg`: A pointer to a null-terminated string that contains an optional message to display with the failure notice. If `msg` is `NULL`, the function will not include a message in the output. The caller retains ownership of the string.
- **Output**: None
- **See Also**: [`failTest`](<tests.c.md#failtest>)  (Implementation)


---
### validateString<!-- {{#callable_declaration:validateString}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../chesslib/src/tests.h#L10>)

Compares two strings and fails the test if they do not match.

This function is useful for validating expected outcomes in test scenarios. Ensure that both input strings are null-terminated and valid. The function does not return control to the caller if the strings differ, as `failTest` will terminate the program.
- **Inputs**:
    - `actual`: A pointer to the actual string to compare. Must be a valid, null-terminated string. Caller retains ownership.
    - `expected`: A pointer to the expected string to compare against. Must be a valid, null-terminated string. Caller retains ownership.
