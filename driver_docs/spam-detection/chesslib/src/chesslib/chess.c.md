Chess game implementation with functions for game state management, move execution, and draw claims.

# Purpose
This code implements a chess game engine in C. It provides functions to create and manage a chess game, initialize game states from a FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) string, and perform operations such as playing moves, undoing moves, and checking game status. The code defines a `chess` structure that maintains the state of the game, including the board history, move history, current legal moves, and terminal state. The functions [`chessCreate`](<#chesscreate>), [`chessCreateFen`](<#chesscreatefen>), and [`chessInitInPlace`](<#chessinitinplace>) are used to initialize a new chess game, either with the standard initial position or a custom position specified by a FEN string.

The code also includes functions to interact with the game state, such as [`chessGetBoard`](<#chessgetboard>), [`chessGetLegalMoves`](<#chessgetlegalmoves>), and [`chessGetTerminalState`](<#chessgetterminalstate>), which retrieve the current board, legal moves, and terminal state, respectively. The [`chessPlayMove`](<#chessplaymove>) function executes a move if it is legal, updating the game state accordingly. The [`chessUndo`](<#chessundo>) function allows the user to revert the last move. The code also provides utility functions to check specific conditions, such as whether a player is in check or if a draw can be claimed based on the 50-move rule or threefold repetition. The [`chessCalculateFields`](<#chesscalculatefields>) function updates the game state, recalculating legal moves and checking for terminal conditions like checkmate or stalemate.
