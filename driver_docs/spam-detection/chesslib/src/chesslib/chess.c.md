Chess game implementation with functions for game state management, move execution, and draw claims.

# Purpose
The code is a C implementation of a chess game, providing functionality to manage and manipulate the state of a chess game. It includes functions to create and initialize a chess game, either from the standard initial position or from a given FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) string. The code manages the game state through a `chess` structure, which includes the board history, move history, current legal moves, repetition count, and terminal state. The code provides functions to play and undo moves, check the game's terminal state, and claim draws based on the 50-move rule or threefold repetition.

The code interfaces with external components through the inclusion of headers `chesslib/chess.h` and `chesslib/move.h`, suggesting it is part of a larger library. It defines public APIs for interacting with the chess game, such as [`chessCreate`](<#chesscreate>), [`chessPlayMove`](<#chessplaymove>), and [`chessGetLegalMoves`](<#chessgetlegalmoves>). The code also includes utility functions to retrieve game information, such as the current board state, move history, and whether a player is in check. The implementation ensures memory management by allocating and freeing resources as needed, and it calculates game-specific fields like legal moves and terminal conditions.
