Implements a linked list for managing chess boards, including creation, addition, retrieval, and removal.

# Purpose
The code implements a linked list data structure specifically designed to manage a collection of `board` objects, which are likely related to a chess application given the inclusion of the header file `chesslib/boardlist.h`. The primary components of this implementation include functions to create a new list ([`boardListCreate`](<#boardlistcreate>)), add a new board to the list ([`boardListAdd`](<#boardlistadd>)), retrieve a board from the list by index ([`boardListGet`](<#boardlistget>)), remove the last board from the list ([`boardListUndo`](<#boardlistundo>)), and free the entire list ([`boardListFree`](<#boardlistfree>)). 

The list is implemented as a singly linked list, where each node (`boardListNode`) contains a pointer to a `board` and a pointer to the next node. The `boardList` structure maintains pointers to the head and tail of the list, as well as the size of the list. The code provides basic operations for managing the list, including memory allocation and deallocation for both the nodes and the boards they contain. The [`boardListUndo`](<#boardlistundo>) function removes the last node from the list, highlighting a limitation in the current implementation due to the lack of a doubly linked list structure, which would simplify this operation.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `stdlib.h`
- `chesslib/boardlist.h`


# Functions

---
### boardListCreate<!-- {{#callable:boardListCreate}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/boardlist.c#L10>)

Allocates and initializes a new `boardList` structure.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Allocate memory for a `boardList` structure using `malloc`.
    - Set the `head` pointer of the list to `NULL`.
    - Set the `tail` pointer of the list to `NULL`.
    - Initialize the `size` of the list to 0.
    - Return the pointer to the newly created `boardList`.
- **Output**: A pointer to a newly allocated and initialized `boardList` structure.


---
### boardListNodeCreate<!-- {{#callable:boardListNodeCreate}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/boardlist.c#L21>)

Allocates memory for a new `boardListNode`, initializes it with a given `board`, and sets its `next` pointer to `NULL`.
- **Inputs**:
    - `b`: A pointer to a `board` structure that the new `boardListNode` will contain.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Allocate memory for a new `boardListNode` using `malloc`.
    - Assign the input `board` pointer `b` to the `board` member of the newly created `boardListNode`.
    - Set the `next` pointer of the new `boardListNode` to `NULL`.
    - Return the pointer to the newly created `boardListNode`.
- **Output**: A pointer to the newly created `boardListNode` containing the specified `board`.


---
### boardListAdd<!-- {{#callable:boardListAdd}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/boardlist.c#L30>)

Adds a new `board` to the end of a `boardList`.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a `boardList` structure where the new `board` will be added.
    - `b`: A pointer to a `board` structure that will be added to the `boardList`.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Create a new `boardListNode` using [`boardListNodeCreate`](<#boardlistnodecreate>) with the given `board` pointer `b`.
    - Check if the `head` of the `list` is `NULL`.
    - If `head` is `NULL`, set both `head` and `tail` of the `list` to the newly created node.
    - If `head` is not `NULL`, set the `next` pointer of the current `tail` to the new node and update the `tail` to the new node.
    - Increment the `size` of the `list` by 1.
- **Output**: No return value.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`boardListNodeCreate`](<#boardlistnodecreate>)


---
### boardListGet<!-- {{#callable:boardListGet}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/boardlist.c#L48>)

Retrieves the `board` at a specified index from a `boardList`.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a `boardList` from which to retrieve the `board`.
    - `index`: An unsigned integer representing the position of the `board` to retrieve in the list.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `currNode` to the head of the list.
    - Iterate through the list, moving `currNode` to the next node and decrementing `index` until `index` is zero.
    - Return the `board` from the `currNode`.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the `board` at the specified index in the `boardList`.


---
### boardListUndo<!-- {{#callable:boardListUndo}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/boardlist.c#L59>)

Removes the last node from a singly linked list of boards and updates the list's size and tail pointer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a `boardList` structure, which represents a singly linked list of board nodes.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Checks if the `list` is `NULL` or if the `list`'s head is `NULL`; if so, returns immediately.
    - If the list has only one node, frees the board and node, then sets both `head` and `tail` to `NULL`.
    - If the list has more than one node, iterates through the list to find the last node and its predecessor.
    - Frees the board and the last node, updates the predecessor's `next` pointer to `NULL`, and sets the `tail` to the predecessor.
    - Decrements the `size` of the list by one.
- **Output**: No return value; the function modifies the `boardList` structure in place.


---
### boardListFree<!-- {{#callable:boardListFree}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/boardlist.c#L92>)

Deallocates all memory associated with a `boardList` and its nodes.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to the `boardList` to be freed.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `node` to the head of the list.
    - Iterate over each node in the list until `node` is NULL.
    - In each iteration, store the next node in `next`, free the current node's `board`, and then free the current node itself.
    - Move to the next node by setting `node` to `next`.
    - After the loop, free the `list` itself.
- **Output**: No return value; the function frees memory and does not return data.
