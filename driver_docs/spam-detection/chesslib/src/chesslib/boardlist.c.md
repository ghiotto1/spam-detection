Implements a linked list for managing chess boards, including creation, addition, retrieval, and removal.

# Purpose
The code implements a linked list structure specifically designed to manage a collection of `board` objects, which are likely related to a chess application given the inclusion of the `chesslib/boardlist.h` header. The primary data structure is `boardList`, which maintains a singly linked list of `boardListNode` elements. Each node contains a pointer to a `board` and a pointer to the next node in the list. The code provides functions to create a new list ([`boardListCreate`](<#boardlistcreate>)), add a new board to the list ([`boardListAdd`](<#boardlistadd>)), retrieve a board by its index ([`boardListGet`](<#boardlistget>)), remove the last board from the list ([`boardListUndo`](<#boardlistundo>)), and free the entire list ([`boardListFree`](<#boardlistfree>)).

The `boardList` structure is initialized with a `head`, `tail`, and `size` to manage the list's state. The [`boardListAdd`](<#boardlistadd>) function appends a new node to the end of the list, updating the `tail` pointer and incrementing the `size`. The [`boardListGet`](<#boardlistget>) function traverses the list to return the board at a specified index. The [`boardListUndo`](<#boardlistundo>) function removes the last node, freeing its associated memory, and updates the list's `tail`. Finally, [`boardListFree`](<#boardlistfree>) deallocates all nodes and their associated boards, ensuring no memory leaks occur. This code is intended to be part of a larger application, likely providing a utility for managing a sequence of chess board states.
# Imports and Dependencies

# Functions

---
### boardListCreate<!-- {{#callable:boardListCreate}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/boardlist.c#L10>)

Initializes and returns a new `boardList` structure with default values.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Allocate memory for a `boardList` structure and assign it to the pointer `list`.
    - Set the `head` pointer of `list` to `NULL`, indicating an empty list.
    - Set the `tail` pointer of `list` to `NULL`, indicating no last element in the list.
    - Initialize the `size` of the list to `0`, indicating the list is empty.
    - Return the pointer `list` to the newly created `boardList` structure.
- **Output**: A pointer to a newly allocated and initialized `boardList` structure.


---
### boardListNodeCreate<!-- {{#callable:boardListNodeCreate}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/boardlist.c#L21>)

Creates a new `boardListNode` and initializes it with a given `board` pointer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `b`: A pointer to a `board` structure that the new node will reference.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Allocate memory for a new `boardListNode` using `malloc`.
    - Assign the input `board` pointer `b` to the `board` field of the new node.
    - Set the `next` pointer of the new node to `NULL`.
    - Return the newly created `boardListNode`.
- **Output**: A pointer to the newly created `boardListNode`.


---
### boardListAdd<!-- {{#callable:boardListAdd}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/boardlist.c#L30>)

Adds a new `board` to the end of a `boardList`.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to the `boardList` where the new `board` will be added.
    - `b`: A pointer to the `board` to add to the `boardList`.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Create a new `boardListNode` using [`boardListNodeCreate`](<#boardlistnodecreate>) with the given `board` `b`.
    - Check if the `head` of the `list` is `NULL`.
    - If `head` is `NULL`, set both `head` and `tail` of the `list` to the new node.
    - If `head` is not `NULL`, set the `next` pointer of the current `tail` to the new node and update the `tail` to the new node.
    - Increment the `size` of the `list` by 1.
- **Output**: No return value; the function modifies the `boardList` in place.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`boardListNodeCreate`](<#boardlistnodecreate>)


---
### boardListGet<!-- {{#callable:boardListGet}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/boardlist.c#L48>)

Retrieves the `board` at a specified `index` from a `boardList`.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a `boardList` from which to retrieve the `board`.
    - `index`: An unsigned integer representing the position of the `board` to retrieve from the list.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `currNode` to the head of the `boardList`.
    - Iterate through the list, moving `currNode` to the next node and decrementing `index` until `index` is zero.
    - Return the `board` from the `currNode`.
- **Output**: A pointer to the `board` at the specified `index` in the `boardList`.


---
### boardListUndo<!-- {{#callable:boardListUndo}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/boardlist.c#L59>)

Removes the last node from a singly linked list of boards and frees its memory.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a `boardList` structure, which represents a singly linked list of board nodes.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if `list` is `NULL` or if `list->head` is `NULL`; if so, return immediately as there is nothing to undo.
    - If the list has only one node (`list->head->next` is `NULL`), free the board and the node, then set `list->head` and `list->tail` to `NULL`.
    - If the list has more than one node, traverse the list to find the last node and its predecessor.
    - Free the board and the last node, set the predecessor's `next` pointer to `NULL`, and update `list->tail` to point to the predecessor.
    - Decrement the `list->size` by one.
- **Output**: No return value; the function modifies the `boardList` in place by removing the last node and updating the list's size.


---
### boardListFree<!-- {{#callable:boardListFree}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/boardlist.c#L92>)

Deallocates all memory associated with a `boardList` and its nodes.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to the `boardList` structure to be freed.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `node` to the head of the list.
    - Enter a loop that continues while `node` is not NULL.
    - Inside the loop, store the next node in `next`, free the `board` associated with the current `node`, and then free the `node` itself.
    - Set `node` to `next` to move to the next node in the list.
    - After the loop, free the `list` itself.
- **Output**: No return value; the function frees memory and does not return data.
