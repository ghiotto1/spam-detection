Implements a linked list for managing chess boards, including creation, addition, retrieval, and removal.

# Purpose
The code implements a linked list data structure specifically designed to manage a collection of `board` objects, which are likely related to a chess application given the inclusion of the `chesslib/boardlist.h` header. The primary components of this implementation include functions for creating and managing a `boardList`, which is a singly linked list. The [`boardListCreate`](<#boardlistcreate>) function initializes a new list, while [`boardListNodeCreate`](<#boardlistnodecreate>) creates individual nodes that hold `board` objects. The [`boardListAdd`](<#boardlistadd>) function appends a new `board` to the end of the list, maintaining the list's order.

Additional functions provide access and management capabilities for the list. The [`boardListGet`](<#boardlistget>) function retrieves a `board` from a specified index in the list, while [`boardListUndo`](<#boardlistundo>) removes the last `board` from the list, effectively undoing the most recent addition. The [`boardListFree`](<#boardlistfree>) function deallocates all memory associated with the list, ensuring no memory leaks occur. This code is intended to be part of a larger application, as it does not define a `main` function and relies on external definitions from the `chesslib/boardlist.h` header.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `stdlib.h`
- `chesslib/boardlist.h`


# Functions

---
### boardListCreate<!-- {{#callable:boardListCreate}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/boardlist.c#L10>)

Allocates and initializes a new `boardList` structure.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Allocate memory for a `boardList` structure and assign it to the pointer `list`.
    - Set the `head` pointer of `list` to `NULL`, indicating an empty list.
    - Set the `tail` pointer of `list` to `NULL`, indicating no last element in the list.
    - Initialize the `size` of the list to 0, indicating the list is empty.
    - Return the pointer to the newly created `boardList`.
- **Output**: A pointer to a newly allocated and initialized `boardList` structure.


---
### boardListNodeCreate<!-- {{#callable:boardListNodeCreate}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/boardlist.c#L21>)

Creates a new `boardListNode` and initializes it with a given `board` pointer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `b`: A pointer to a `board` structure that the new node will contain.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Allocate memory for a new `boardListNode` using `malloc`.
    - Assign the provided `board` pointer `b` to the `board` field of the new node.
    - Set the `next` pointer of the new node to `NULL`.
    - Return the newly created `boardListNode`.
- **Output**: A pointer to the newly created `boardListNode`.


---
### boardListAdd<!-- {{#callable:boardListAdd}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/boardlist.c#L30>)

Adds a new board to the end of a linked list of boards.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a `boardList` structure where the new board will be added.
    - `b`: A pointer to a `board` structure that will be added to the list.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Create a new `boardListNode` using the [`boardListNodeCreate`](<#boardlistnodecreate>) function with the board `b`.
    - Check if the `head` of the list is `NULL`, indicating the list is empty.
    - If the list is empty, set both the `head` and `tail` of the list to the new node.
    - If the list is not empty, set the `next` pointer of the current `tail` to the new node and update the `tail` to the new node.
    - Increment the `size` of the list by 1.
- **Output**: No return value; the function modifies the `boardList` structure in place.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`boardListNodeCreate`](<#boardlistnodecreate>)


---
### boardListGet<!-- {{#callable:boardListGet}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/boardlist.c#L48>)

Retrieves the `board` at a specified index from a `boardList`.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a `boardList` from which to retrieve the `board`.
    - `index`: An unsigned integer representing the position of the `board` to retrieve in the list.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `currNode` to the head of the list.
    - Iterate through the list, moving `currNode` to the next node and decrementing `index` until `index` is zero.
    - Return the `board` from the `currNode`.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the `board` at the specified index in the `boardList`.


---
### boardListUndo<!-- {{#callable:boardListUndo}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/boardlist.c#L59>)

Removes the last node from a singly linked list of boards and frees its memory.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a `boardList` structure, which represents a singly linked list of boards.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Checks if the `list` is `NULL` or if the `list->head` is `NULL`; if so, returns immediately.
    - If the list has only one node, frees the board and the node, then sets `list->head` and `list->tail` to `NULL`.
    - If the list has more than one node, iterates through the list to find the last node and its predecessor.
    - Frees the board and the last node, updates the predecessor's `next` pointer to `NULL`, and sets `list->tail` to the predecessor.
    - Decrements the `list->size` by one.
- **Output**: No return value; the function modifies the `boardList` in place.


---
### boardListFree<!-- {{#callable:boardListFree}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/boardlist.c#L92>)

Deallocates all memory associated with a `boardList` and its nodes.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to the `boardList` structure to be freed.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `node` to the head of the list.
    - Enter a loop that continues while `node` is not NULL.
    - Inside the loop, store the next node in `next`.
    - Free the memory allocated for `node->board`.
    - Free the memory allocated for `node`.
    - Set `node` to `next` to move to the next node in the list.
    - After the loop, free the memory allocated for the `list` itself.
- **Output**: No return value; the function frees memory and does not return data.
