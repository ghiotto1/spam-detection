Implements a linked list for managing chess boards, including creation, addition, retrieval, and removal.

# Purpose
The code implements a linked list data structure specifically designed to manage a collection of `board` objects, which are likely related to a chess application given the inclusion of the `chesslib/boardlist.h` header. The primary components of this implementation include functions to create a new list ([`boardListCreate`](<#boardlistcreate>)), add a new board to the list ([`boardListAdd`](<#boardlistadd>)), retrieve a board from the list by index ([`boardListGet`](<#boardlistget>)), remove the last board from the list ([`boardListUndo`](<#boardlistundo>)), and free the entire list ([`boardListFree`](<#boardlistfree>)). 

The list is implemented as a singly linked list, with each node containing a pointer to a `board` and a pointer to the next node. The `boardList` structure maintains pointers to the head and tail of the list, as well as the size of the list. The code provides basic operations for managing the list, such as adding and removing nodes, but does not include more complex operations like searching or sorting. The [`boardListUndo`](<#boardlistundo>) function highlights a limitation of the current implementation, as it would be more efficient with a doubly linked list. The code is intended to be part of a larger application, as it relies on external definitions for the `board` and `boardListNode` structures.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `stdlib.h`
- `chesslib/boardlist.h`


# Functions

---
### boardListCreate<!-- {{#callable:boardListCreate}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/boardlist.c#L10>)

Allocates and initializes a new `boardList` structure.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Allocate memory for a `boardList` structure using `malloc`.
    - Set the `head` pointer of the list to `NULL`.
    - Set the `tail` pointer of the list to `NULL`.
    - Initialize the `size` of the list to 0.
    - Return the pointer to the newly created `boardList`.
- **Output**: A pointer to a newly allocated and initialized `boardList` structure.


---
### boardListNodeCreate<!-- {{#callable:boardListNodeCreate}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/boardlist.c#L21>)

Creates a new `boardListNode` and initializes it with a given `board` pointer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `b`: A pointer to a `board` structure that the new node will contain.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Allocate memory for a new `boardListNode` using `malloc`.
    - Assign the input `board` pointer `b` to the `board` field of the new node.
    - Set the `next` pointer of the new node to `NULL`.
    - Return the newly created node.
- **Output**: A pointer to the newly created `boardListNode`.


---
### boardListAdd<!-- {{#callable:boardListAdd}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/boardlist.c#L30>)

Adds a new `board` to the end of a `boardList`.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a `boardList` structure where the new `board` will be added.
    - `b`: A pointer to a `board` structure that will be added to the `boardList`.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Create a new `boardListNode` using [`boardListNodeCreate`](<#boardlistnodecreate>) with the given `board` pointer `b`.
    - Check if the `head` of the `boardList` is `NULL`.
    - If `head` is `NULL`, set both `head` and `tail` of the `boardList` to the newly created node.
    - If `head` is not `NULL`, set the `next` pointer of the current `tail` to the new node and update the `tail` to the new node.
    - Increment the `size` of the `boardList` by 1.
- **Output**: No return value; the function modifies the `boardList` in place by adding a new node.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`boardListNodeCreate`](<#boardlistnodecreate>)


---
### boardListGet<!-- {{#callable:boardListGet}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/boardlist.c#L48>)

Retrieves the `board` at a specified index from a `boardList`.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a `boardList` from which to retrieve the `board`.
    - `index`: An unsigned integer representing the position of the `board` to retrieve in the list.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `currNode` to the head of the list.
    - Iterate through the list, moving `currNode` to the next node and decrementing `index` until `index` is zero.
    - Return the `board` from the `currNode`.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the `board` at the specified index in the `boardList`.


---
### boardListUndo<!-- {{#callable:boardListUndo}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/boardlist.c#L59>)

Removes the last node from a singly linked list of boards and updates the list's size and tail pointer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a `boardList` structure, which represents a singly linked list of board nodes.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if `list` is `NULL` or if `list->head` is `NULL`; if true, return immediately.
    - If the list has only one node, free the board and node, then set `list->head` and `list->tail` to `NULL`.
    - If the list has more than one node, traverse the list to find the last node and its predecessor.
    - Free the board and the last node, update the predecessor's `next` pointer to `NULL`, and set `list->tail` to the predecessor.
    - Decrement the `list->size` by one.
- **Output**: No return value; the function modifies the `boardList` structure in place.


---
### boardListFree<!-- {{#callable:boardListFree}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/boardlist.c#L92>)

Deallocates all memory associated with a `boardList` and its nodes.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to the `boardList` structure to be freed.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `node` to the head of the list.
    - Enter a loop that continues while `node` is not NULL.
    - Inside the loop, store the next node in `next`.
    - Free the memory allocated for `node->board`.
    - Free the memory allocated for `node`.
    - Set `node` to `next` to proceed to the next node in the list.
    - After the loop, free the memory allocated for the `list` itself.
- **Output**: No return value; the function frees memory and does not return data.
