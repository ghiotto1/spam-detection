Functions for handling chess pieces, including type and color identification and letter representation.

# Purpose
The code provides functionality for handling chess pieces within a chess library. It defines several functions that operate on a type `piece`, which represents a chess piece, and provides utilities to determine the type and color of a piece. The function [`pieceGetType`](<#piecegettype>) returns the type of a given piece, while [`pieceGetColor`](<#piecegetcolor>) returns the color. The function [`pieceTypeGetLetter`](<#piecetypegetletter>) maps a `pieceType` to its corresponding letter representation, such as 'P' for pawn or 'K' for king. The function [`pieceGetLetter`](<#piecegetletter>) returns the letter representation of a piece, converting it to lowercase if the piece is black.

Additionally, the code includes a function [`pieceMake`](<#piecemake>) that constructs a `piece` based on a specified `pieceType` and `pieceColor`. It returns the appropriate piece constant for white or black pieces, or `pEmpty` if the color is invalid. The code relies on predefined constants and types such as `pWPawn`, `pBPawn`, `pcWhite`, `pcBlack`, and `pcNoColor`, which are likely defined in the included header file `chesslib/piece.h`. This module is part of a broader chess library, focusing on the representation and manipulation of individual chess pieces.

# Functions

---
### pieceGetType<!-- {{#callable:pieceGetType}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/piece.c#L10>)

Determines the type of a chess piece based on its enumeration value.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: An enumeration value representing a chess piece, which can be a white or black piece.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Checks if the input `p` is greater than or equal to `pBPawn`.
    - If true, adjusts `p` by subtracting `pBPawn` and adding 1 to normalize the value to a `pieceType`.
    - Casts the adjusted or original `p` to `pieceType` and returns it.
- **Output**: Returns the `pieceType` of the given chess piece.


---
### pieceGetColor<!-- {{#callable:pieceGetColor}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/piece.c#L18>)

Determines the color of a chess piece based on its enumeration value.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: An enumeration value representing a chess piece.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if `p` is within the range of white pieces (`pWPawn` to `pWKing`).
    - If true, return `pcWhite`.
    - Check if `p` is within the range of black pieces (`pBPawn` to `pBKing`).
    - If true, return `pcBlack`.
    - If neither condition is met, return `pcNoColor`.
- **Output**: Returns a `pieceColor` enumeration value indicating the color of the piece (`pcWhite`, `pcBlack`, or `pcNoColor`).


---
### pieceTypeGetLetter<!-- {{#callable:pieceTypeGetLetter}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/piece.c#L29>)

Maps a `pieceType` to its corresponding letter representation in chess notation.
- **Inputs**:
    - `pe`: A `pieceType` enumeration value representing a type of chess piece.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Use a `switch` statement to determine the letter based on the `pieceType` value.
    - Return 'P' for `ptPawn`.
    - Return 'N' for `ptKnight`.
    - Return 'B' for `ptBishop`.
    - Return 'R' for `ptRook`.
    - Return 'Q' for `ptQueen`.
    - Return 'K' for `ptKing`.
    - Return a space character ' ' for `ptEmpty`.
    - Return 0 for any unrecognized `pieceType` value.
- **Output**: A character representing the chess piece type, or 0 if the type is unrecognized.


---
### pieceGetLetter<!-- {{#callable:pieceGetLetter}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/piece.c#L60>)

Returns the character representation of a chess piece, using lowercase for black pieces.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: A `piece` object representing a chess piece.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Call [`pieceGetType`](<#piecegettype>) with `p` to get the type of the piece.
    - Call [`pieceTypeGetLetter`](<#piecetypegetletter>) with the result to get the character representation of the piece type.
    - Check if the color of the piece is black by calling [`pieceGetColor`](<#piecegetcolor>) with `p`.
    - If the piece is black, convert the character to lowercase using `tolower`.
    - Return the character.
- **Output**: A character representing the piece type, in lowercase if the piece is black.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`pieceTypeGetLetter`](<#piecetypegetletter>)
    - [`pieceGetType`](<#piecegettype>)
    - [`pieceGetColor`](<#piecegetcolor>)


---
### pieceMake<!-- {{#callable:pieceMake}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/piece.c#L70>)

Creates a chess piece based on the specified type and color.
- **Inputs**:
    - `type`: The type of the chess piece, represented by the `pieceType` enumeration (e.g., `ptKing`, `ptQueen`).
    - `color`: The color of the chess piece, represented by the `pieceColor` enumeration (e.g., `pcWhite`, `pcBlack`).
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if `color` is either `pcWhite` or `pcBlack`; if not, return `pEmpty`.
    - Use a `switch` statement to determine the `type` of the piece.
    - For each case in the `switch` statement, return the corresponding piece constant based on the `color`.
    - If `type` does not match any case, return `pEmpty`.
- **Output**: Returns a `piece` constant representing the specified type and color, or `pEmpty` if the color is invalid or the type is unrecognized.
