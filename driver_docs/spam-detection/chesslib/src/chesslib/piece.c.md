Implements functions for handling chess pieces, including type, color, and letter representation.

# Purpose
This code provides functionality for handling chess pieces within a chess library. It defines several functions that operate on a data type `piece`, which represents a chess piece. The functions include [`pieceGetType`](<#piecegettype>), which determines the type of a piece, and [`pieceGetColor`](<#piecegetcolor>), which identifies the color of a piece. The function [`pieceTypeGetLetter`](<#piecetypegetletter>) returns the character representation of a piece type, while [`pieceGetLetter`](<#piecegetletter>) provides the character representation of a piece, considering its color. The function [`pieceMake`](<#piecemake>) creates a piece based on a specified type and color.

The code is part of a broader chess library, as indicated by the inclusion of the header file `chesslib/piece.h`. It does not define public APIs or external interfaces directly but provides utility functions that are likely used internally within the library to manage and manipulate chess pieces. The code handles both white and black pieces and includes a mechanism to return an empty piece if an invalid color is specified. The use of enumerations or constants such as `pWPawn`, `pBPawn`, `ptPawn`, and `pcWhite` suggests that these are defined elsewhere, likely in the included header file.

# Functions

---
### pieceGetType<!-- {{#callable:pieceGetType}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/piece.c#L10>)

Determines the type of a chess piece based on its enumeration value.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: An enumeration value representing a chess piece, which can be a white or black piece.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if `p` is greater than or equal to `pBPawn`.
    - If true, adjust `p` by subtracting `pBPawn` and adding 1 to normalize it to a `pieceType`.
    - Cast the adjusted or original `p` to `pieceType` and return it.
- **Output**: Returns the `pieceType` of the given chess piece `p`.


---
### pieceGetColor<!-- {{#callable:pieceGetColor}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/piece.c#L18>)

Determines the color of a chess piece based on its enumeration value.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: An enumeration value representing a chess piece.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if `p` is within the range of white pieces (`pWPawn` to `pWKing`).
    - If true, return `pcWhite`.
    - Check if `p` is within the range of black pieces (`pBPawn` to `pBKing`).
    - If true, return `pcBlack`.
    - If neither condition is met, return `pcNoColor`.
- **Output**: Returns a `pieceColor` enumeration value indicating the color of the piece (`pcWhite`, `pcBlack`, or `pcNoColor`).


---
### pieceTypeGetLetter<!-- {{#callable:pieceTypeGetLetter}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/piece.c#L29>)

Maps a `pieceType` to its corresponding letter representation in chess notation.
- **Inputs**:
    - `pe`: A `pieceType` enumeration value representing a type of chess piece.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Use a `switch` statement to determine the letter based on the `pieceType` value.
    - Return 'P' for `ptPawn`.
    - Return 'N' for `ptKnight`.
    - Return 'B' for `ptBishop`.
    - Return 'R' for `ptRook`.
    - Return 'Q' for `ptQueen`.
    - Return 'K' for `ptKing`.
    - Return a space character ' ' for `ptEmpty`.
    - Return 0 for any unrecognized `pieceType` value.
- **Output**: A `char` representing the letter associated with the given `pieceType`, or 0 if the type is unrecognized.


---
### pieceGetLetter<!-- {{#callable:pieceGetLetter}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/piece.c#L60>)

Returns the character representation of a chess piece, using lowercase for black pieces.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: A `piece` object representing a chess piece.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Call [`pieceGetType`](<#piecegettype>) with `p` to get the type of the piece.
    - Call [`pieceTypeGetLetter`](<#piecetypegetletter>) with the result to get the character representation of the piece type.
    - Check if the color of the piece is black by calling [`pieceGetColor`](<#piecegetcolor>) with `p`.
    - If the piece is black, convert the character to lowercase using `tolower`.
    - Return the character.
- **Output**: A character representing the type of the chess piece, in lowercase if the piece is black.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`pieceTypeGetLetter`](<#piecetypegetletter>)
    - [`pieceGetType`](<#piecegettype>)
    - [`pieceGetColor`](<#piecegetcolor>)


---
### pieceMake<!-- {{#callable:pieceMake}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/piece.c#L70>)

Creates a chess piece based on the specified type and color.
- **Inputs**:
    - `type`: The type of the chess piece, represented by the `pieceType` enumeration (e.g., `ptKing`, `ptQueen`, etc.).
    - `color`: The color of the chess piece, represented by the `pieceColor` enumeration (`pcWhite` or `pcBlack`).
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if `color` is either `pcWhite` or `pcBlack`; if not, return `pEmpty`.
    - Use a `switch` statement to determine the `type` of the piece.
    - For each case in the `switch` statement, return the corresponding piece constant based on the `color`.
    - If `type` does not match any case, return `pEmpty`.
- **Output**: A `piece` value representing the specified chess piece, or `pEmpty` if the input is invalid.
