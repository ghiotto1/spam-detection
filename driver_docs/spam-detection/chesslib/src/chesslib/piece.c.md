Functions for handling chess pieces, including type and color determination and letter representation.

# Purpose
The code is a C implementation for handling chess pieces, providing functions to determine the type and color of a piece, convert piece types to their corresponding letter representations, and create pieces based on type and color. It includes functions such as [`pieceGetType`](<#piecegettype>), [`pieceGetColor`](<#piecegetcolor>), [`pieceTypeGetLetter`](<#piecetypegetletter>), [`pieceGetLetter`](<#piecegetletter>), and [`pieceMake`](<#piecemake>). These functions operate on enumerated types `piece`, `pieceType`, and `pieceColor`, which are likely defined in the included header file `chesslib/piece.h`.

The function [`pieceGetType`](<#piecegettype>) determines the type of a piece, while [`pieceGetColor`](<#piecegetcolor>) identifies its color. The function [`pieceTypeGetLetter`](<#piecetypegetletter>) returns the letter representation of a piece type, and [`pieceGetLetter`](<#piecegetletter>) provides the letter representation of a piece, adjusting for color by converting to lowercase for black pieces. The [`pieceMake`](<#piecemake>) function constructs a piece based on the specified type and color, returning an empty piece if the color is invalid. This code is part of a broader chess library, focusing on the manipulation and representation of chess pieces.

# Functions

---
### pieceGetType<!-- {{#callable:pieceGetType}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/piece.c#L10>)

Determines the type of a chess piece based on its enumeration value.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: An enumeration value representing a chess piece, which can be a white or black piece.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if the input `p` is greater than or equal to `pBPawn`.
    - If true, adjust `p` by subtracting `pBPawn` and adding 1 to normalize the piece type for black pieces.
    - Cast the adjusted or original `p` to `pieceType` and return it.
- **Output**: Returns the `pieceType` of the given chess piece, which is an enumeration value representing the type of the piece (e.g., pawn, knight, bishop, etc.).


---
### pieceGetColor<!-- {{#callable:pieceGetColor}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/piece.c#L18>)

Determines the color of a chess piece based on its type.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: A `piece` representing a chess piece whose color is to be determined.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if `p` is within the range of white pieces (`pWPawn` to `pWKing`); if true, return `pcWhite`.
    - Check if `p` is within the range of black pieces (`pBPawn` to `pBKing`); if true, return `pcBlack`.
    - If `p` does not fall within the specified ranges, return `pcNoColor`.
- **Output**: Returns a `pieceColor` indicating the color of the piece: `pcWhite`, `pcBlack`, or `pcNoColor` if the piece does not match any known color range.


---
### pieceTypeGetLetter<!-- {{#callable:pieceTypeGetLetter}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/piece.c#L29>)

Maps a `pieceType` enumeration to its corresponding letter representation for chess pieces.
- **Inputs**:
    - `pe`: A `pieceType` enumeration value representing a type of chess piece.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Use a `switch` statement to check the value of `pe`.
    - Return 'P' if `pe` is `ptPawn`.
    - Return 'N' if `pe` is `ptKnight`.
    - Return 'B' if `pe` is `ptBishop`.
    - Return 'R' if `pe` is `ptRook`.
    - Return 'Q' if `pe` is `ptQueen`.
    - Return 'K' if `pe` is `ptKing`.
    - Return a space character ' ' if `pe` is `ptEmpty`.
    - Return 0 for any other value of `pe`.
- **Output**: A character representing the chess piece type, or 0 if the type is not recognized.


---
### pieceGetLetter<!-- {{#callable:pieceGetLetter}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/piece.c#L60>)

Returns the character representation of a chess piece, using lowercase for black pieces.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: A `piece` representing a chess piece, which includes both type and color information.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Call `pieceGetType(p)` to get the type of the piece `p`.
    - Call `pieceTypeGetLetter()` with the piece type to get the corresponding character representation.
    - Check if the color of the piece `p` is black by calling `pieceGetColor(p)`.
    - If the piece is black, convert the character to lowercase using `tolower()`.
    - Return the character representation of the piece.
- **Output**: A character representing the type of the chess piece, in lowercase if the piece is black.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`pieceTypeGetLetter`](<#piecetypegetletter>)
    - [`pieceGetType`](<#piecegettype>)
    - [`pieceGetColor`](<#piecegetcolor>)


---
### pieceMake<!-- {{#callable:pieceMake}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/piece.c#L70>)

Creates a chess piece based on the specified type and color.
- **Inputs**:
    - `type`: The type of the chess piece, represented by the `pieceType` enumeration (e.g., `ptKing`, `ptQueen`).
    - `color`: The color of the chess piece, represented by the `pieceColor` enumeration (e.g., `pcWhite`, `pcBlack`).
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if `color` is either `pcWhite` or `pcBlack`; if not, return `pEmpty`.
    - Use a `switch` statement to determine the piece to return based on `type`.
    - For each case in the `switch` statement, return the corresponding piece for the given `color`.
    - If `type` does not match any case, return `pEmpty`.
- **Output**: A `piece` value representing the specified chess piece, or `pEmpty` if the input is invalid.
