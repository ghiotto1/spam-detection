Functions for handling chess pieces, including type and color identification and letter representation.

# Purpose
This code provides functionality for handling chess pieces within a chess library. It defines several functions that operate on a type `piece`, which represents a chess piece, and related types `pieceType` and `pieceColor`. The functions include [`pieceGetType`](<#piecegettype>), which determines the type of a piece, and [`pieceGetColor`](<#piecegetcolor>), which determines the color of a piece. The function [`pieceTypeGetLetter`](<#piecetypegetletter>) returns a character representing the type of a piece, while [`pieceGetLetter`](<#piecegetletter>) returns a character representing the piece, with lowercase letters indicating black pieces. The function [`pieceMake`](<#piecemake>) creates a piece based on a specified type and color, returning a corresponding `piece` value or `pEmpty` if the color is invalid.

The code is part of a broader chess library, as indicated by the inclusion of the header file `chesslib/piece.h`. It is not an executable but rather a component intended to be used within a larger application or library. The functions defined here provide a narrow set of operations focused on the representation and manipulation of chess pieces, including type and color determination, character representation, and piece creation. The code does not define public APIs or external interfaces directly but provides essential functionality for managing chess pieces in a structured manner.
# Imports and Dependencies

- `ctype.h`
- `chesslib/piece.h`


# Functions

---
### pieceGetType<!-- {{#callable:pieceGetType}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/piece.c#L10>)

Determines the type of a chess piece based on its enumeration value.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: An enumeration value representing a chess piece, which can be a white or black piece.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if `p` is greater than or equal to `pBPawn`.
    - If true, adjust `p` by subtracting `pBPawn` and adding 1 to normalize the value to a `pieceType`.
    - Return the adjusted value cast to `pieceType`.
- **Output**: A `pieceType` enumeration value representing the type of the chess piece.


---
### pieceGetColor<!-- {{#callable:pieceGetColor}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/piece.c#L18>)

Determines the color of a chess piece based on its enumeration value.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: An enumeration value representing a chess piece.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if `p` is within the range of white pieces (`pWPawn` to `pWKing`).
    - If true, return `pcWhite`.
    - Check if `p` is within the range of black pieces (`pBPawn` to `pBKing`).
    - If true, return `pcBlack`.
    - If neither condition is met, return `pcNoColor`.
- **Output**: Returns a `pieceColor` enumeration value indicating the color of the piece (`pcWhite`, `pcBlack`, or `pcNoColor`).


---
### pieceTypeGetLetter<!-- {{#callable:pieceTypeGetLetter}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/piece.c#L29>)

Maps a `pieceType` to its corresponding letter representation in chess notation.
- **Inputs**:
    - `pe`: A `pieceType` enumeration value representing a type of chess piece.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Use a `switch` statement to determine the letter based on the `pieceType` value.
    - Return 'P' for `ptPawn`.
    - Return 'N' for `ptKnight`.
    - Return 'B' for `ptBishop`.
    - Return 'R' for `ptRook`.
    - Return 'Q' for `ptQueen`.
    - Return 'K' for `ptKing`.
    - Return a space character ' ' for `ptEmpty`.
    - Return 0 for any unrecognized `pieceType`.
- **Output**: A `char` representing the letter associated with the given `pieceType`, or 0 if the type is unrecognized.


---
### pieceGetLetter<!-- {{#callable:pieceGetLetter}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/piece.c#L60>)

Returns the character representation of a chess piece, using lowercase for black pieces.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: A `piece` object representing a chess piece.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Call [`pieceGetType`](<#piecegettype>) with `p` to get the type of the piece.
    - Call [`pieceTypeGetLetter`](<#piecetypegetletter>) with the result to get the character representation of the piece type.
    - Call [`pieceGetColor`](<#piecegetcolor>) with `p` to determine the color of the piece.
    - If the piece color is `pcBlack`, convert the character to lowercase using `tolower`.
    - Return the character.
- **Output**: A character representing the piece type, in lowercase if the piece is black.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`pieceTypeGetLetter`](<#piecetypegetletter>)
    - [`pieceGetType`](<#piecegettype>)
    - [`pieceGetColor`](<#piecegetcolor>)


---
### pieceMake<!-- {{#callable:pieceMake}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/piece.c#L70>)

Creates a chess piece based on the specified type and color.
- **Inputs**:
    - `type`: The type of the chess piece, represented by the `pieceType` enumeration (e.g., `ptKing`, `ptQueen`, etc.).
    - `color`: The color of the chess piece, represented by the `pieceColor` enumeration (`pcWhite` or `pcBlack`).
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Check if `color` is either `pcWhite` or `pcBlack`; if not, return `pEmpty`.
    - Use a `switch` statement to determine the `type` of the piece.
    - For each case in the `switch` statement, return the corresponding piece constant based on the `color`.
    - If `type` does not match any case, return `pEmpty`.
- **Output**: Returns a `piece` constant representing the specified type and color, or `pEmpty` if the color is invalid or the type is unrecognized.
