Implements movement logic for chess pieces, including pawns, knights, bishops, rooks, queens, and kings.

# Purpose
The code defines functions for determining the possible moves of chess pieces on a chessboard. It includes functions for each type of chess piece: pawns, knights, bishops, rooks, queens, and kings. The functions calculate valid moves based on the current position of a piece and the rules of chess, such as movement patterns and capturing logic. The code uses helper functions like [`canMoveHere`](<#canmovehere>) to check if a move is valid, considering the presence of other pieces and their colors.

The code is organized into functions that generate move lists for each piece type. For example, [`pmGetPawnMoves`](<#pmgetpawnmoves>) handles pawn movement, including forward moves, captures, and promotions. The [`pmLeaperMoveList`](<#pmleapermovelist>) and [`pmRiderMoveList`](<#pmridermovelist>) functions are used to handle the movement logic for leaping and sliding pieces, respectively. The code uses arrays to define movement directions for each piece type, such as `knightOffsets` for knights and `bishopOffsets` for bishops. The functions return a `moveList`, which is a collection of possible moves for a given piece from its current position.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `chesslib/piecemoves.h`


# Global Variables

---
### knightOffsets
- **Type**: `int8_t[8][2]`
- **Description**: Defines the possible move offsets for a knight in a chess game. Each pair of integers represents a relative move in terms of file and rank on the chessboard.
- **Use**: Used to calculate the potential moves a knight can make from a given position on the board.


---
### bishopOffsets
- **Type**: `int8_t[4][2]`
- **Description**: Defines the possible movement directions for a bishop in a chess game. Each pair of integers represents a direction on the chessboard: diagonal up-right, diagonal up-left, diagonal down-left, and diagonal down-right.
- **Use**: Used in the `pmGetBishopMoves` function to calculate all possible moves for a bishop on the board.


---
### rookOffsets
- **Type**: `int8_t[4][2]`
- **Description**: Defines the directional offsets for a rook's movement on a chessboard. Each pair of integers represents a direction in which a rook can move: vertically or horizontally.
- **Use**: Used in the `pmGetRookMoves` function to determine possible moves for a rook.


---
### royalOffsets
- **Type**: `int8_t[8][2]`
- **Description**: `royalOffsets` is a two-dimensional array that defines the possible movement directions for the queen and king in a chess game. Each sub-array contains two integers representing the change in file and rank for a move.
- **Use**: Used to determine the movement directions for the queen and king pieces in the `pmGetQueenMoves` and `pmGetKingMoves` functions.


# Functions

---
### canMoveHere<!-- {{#callable:canMoveHere}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/src/chesslib/piecemoves.c#L15>)

Determines if a move to a specified square is possible based on the presence and color of a piece on that square.
- **Inputs**:
    - `b`: A pointer to the `board` structure representing the current state of the chessboard.
    - `s`: The `sq` structure representing the target square on the board.
    - `ourColor`: The `pieceColor` enumeration value representing the color of the piece attempting to move.
- **Logic and Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the piece located at square `s` on the board `b` using [`boardGetPiece`](<board.c.md#boardgetpiece>) function.
    - Check if the retrieved piece is `pEmpty`, indicating the square is empty; if so, return 1 (true).
    - If the square is not empty, get the color of the piece using [`pieceGetColor`](<piece.c.md#piecegetcolor>).
    - Compare the color of the piece on the square with `ourColor`; return 1 (true) if they are different, otherwise return 0 (false).
- **Output**: Returns an integer value: 1 if the move is possible (the square is empty or occupied by an opponent's piece), or 0 if the square is occupied by a piece of the same color.
- **Functions Called**:
    - [`boardGetPiece`](<board.c.md#boardgetpiece>)
    - [`pieceGetColor`](<piece.c.md#piecegetcolor>)
