Specifies files and directories to ignore in version control for the spam-detection project.

# Purpose
This file is a `.gitignore` configuration file used in a Git repository to specify files and directories that Git should ignore. It includes patterns for various types of files that are typically generated during the build process and are not necessary to track in version control. The file lists common file extensions and directories for object files, linker output, precompiled headers, libraries, shared objects, executables, debug files, and kernel module compile results. By ignoring these files, the repository remains clean and only includes source files and other necessary assets, reducing clutter and potential merge conflicts. The file also includes a reference to its origin, indicating it is based on a standard template from GitHub's collection of `.gitignore` templates for C projects.
