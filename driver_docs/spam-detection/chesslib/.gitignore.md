Specifies ignored files for version control, including executables, object files, and debug files.

# Purpose
The file is a `.gitignore` file used in a software codebase to specify files and directories that Git should ignore. It includes patterns for various types of files that are typically generated during the build process and are not necessary to track in version control. These patterns include object files (`*.o`, `*.obj`), linker outputs (`*.ilk`, `*.map`), precompiled headers (`*.gch`, `*.pch`), libraries (`*.lib`, `*.a`), shared objects (`*.dll`, `*.so`), executables (`*.exe`, `*.out`), and debug files (`*.dSYM/`, `*.pdb`). Additionally, it covers kernel module compile results such as `*.mod*` and `modules.order`. By ignoring these files, the `.gitignore` file helps maintain a clean repository by excluding unnecessary files from being committed.
