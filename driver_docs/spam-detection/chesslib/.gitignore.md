Specifies files and directories to ignore in version control, including executables and build artifacts.

# Purpose
The file is a `.gitignore` file used in a software codebase to specify which files and directories Git should ignore when committing changes. It includes patterns for various types of files that are typically generated during the build process and are not necessary to track in version control. These patterns include object files (`*.o`, `*.ko`), linker outputs (`*.ilk`, `*.map`), precompiled headers (`*.gch`, `*.pch`), libraries (`*.lib`, `*.a`), shared objects (`*.dll`, `*.so`), executables (`*.exe`, `*.out`), and debug files (`*.dSYM/`, `*.pdb`). Additionally, it includes entries for kernel module compile results, such as `*.mod*` and `modules.order`, which are also not needed in the repository. By ignoring these files, the `.gitignore` file helps maintain a clean and efficient version control system.
