Specifies ignored files for version control, including executables, object files, and debug files.

# Purpose
This file is a `.gitignore` configuration file used in a Git repository to specify files and directories that Git should ignore. It includes patterns for various types of files typically generated during software development and compilation processes. The file lists extensions for object files, linker outputs, precompiled headers, libraries, shared objects, executables, debug files, and kernel module compile results. By ignoring these files, the `.gitignore` file helps to keep the repository clean and free from unnecessary binary files and build artifacts, which are not needed in version control. This ensures that only the source code and essential files are tracked, reducing clutter and potential merge conflicts.
