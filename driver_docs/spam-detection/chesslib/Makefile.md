Build instructions for a C-based chess library and test executable with platform-independent settings.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` is used to automate the build process for a Chess implementation in C. It defines the compiler as `gcc` and sets the compiler flags with `-Wall` for warnings. If the `DEBUG` variable is set to 1, it adds the `-g` flag for debugging information; otherwise, it uses `-g0` to omit it. The file specifies source files located in `src/chesslib` and `src` directories, and it compiles them into object files. It creates a static library `libchesslib.a` and a test executable `tests` or `tests.exe` depending on the operating system. The `Makefile` includes targets for building the library, running tests, and cleaning up generated files.
