Makefile for building a C-based chess library and test executable with platform-independent settings.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` is used to automate the build process for a Chess implementation in C. It defines the compiler as `gcc` and sets the compiler flags to include all warnings. If the `DEBUG` variable is set to 1, it adds debugging information to the build; otherwise, it omits it. The file specifies source files located in `src/chesslib` and `src` directories, and it compiles them into object files. It creates a static library `libchesslib.a` and a test executable, with platform-specific naming for Windows. The `Makefile` includes targets for building the library, running tests, creating the `bin` directory, and cleaning up generated files.
