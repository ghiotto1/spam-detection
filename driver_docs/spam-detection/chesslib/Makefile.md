Makefile for building a C-based chess library and tests with platform-independent settings.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` is used to automate the build process for a Chess implementation in C. It defines the compiler as `gcc` and sets the compiler flags to include all warnings. If the `DEBUG` variable is set to 1, it adds debugging information to the compiler flags; otherwise, it disables debugging information. The file specifies source files located in `src/chesslib` and `src` directories, and it compiles these into object files, excluding the `src/tests.o` file from the main library build. The `Makefile` also handles platform-specific differences for executable naming, with separate targets for building the chess library and test executable. It includes rules for creating a `bin` directory, cleaning up compiled files, and running tests.
