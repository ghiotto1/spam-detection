Makefile for building a C-based chess library and tests with platform-independent settings.

# Purpose
The `Makefile` is used to automate the build process for a Chess implementation in C. It defines the compiler as `gcc` and sets the compiler flags to include all warnings. The file includes a conditional statement to add debugging information based on the `DEBUG` variable. It specifies source files located in the `src/chesslib` and `src` directories and generates object files from these sources. The `Makefile` also handles platform independence by setting different executable names for Windows and other operating systems. It defines targets for building the chess library (`chesslib`), running tests (`tests`), and creating necessary directories (`bin`). The `clean` target removes compiled object files and the `bin` directory, while the `test` target executes the test suite.
