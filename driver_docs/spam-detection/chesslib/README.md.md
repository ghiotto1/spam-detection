Instructions for building and testing a C-based chess library with example code and future plans.

# Purpose
The document describes the build and usage instructions for `chesslib`, a chess implementation written in C. It provides guidance on compiling the source files located in the `src/chesslib` directory using a C compiler, with specific instructions for building on Linux and Windows using MSYS2. The makefile included in the project facilitates the build process, and users can execute `make` to compile the library or `make test` to run tests. Additionally, the document includes an example program that demonstrates how to use `chesslib` to simulate a random chess game, printing the UCI moves and the final FEN position. Future development plans for `chesslib` include support for SAN and PGN formats, improved documentation, and enhancements to the API.
