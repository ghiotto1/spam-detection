Instructions for building and testing a C-based chess library with example code and future plans.

# Purpose
The document describes the build and usage instructions for a C-based chess library named `chesslib`. It provides guidance on compiling the source files located in the `src/chesslib` directory using a C compiler, with specific instructions for building on Linux and Windows using MSYS2. The document includes commands for building the library and running tests using a makefile. Additionally, it provides an example program that demonstrates how to use the library to simulate a random chess game, printing the UCI moves and the final FEN position. Future development plans for the library include support for SAN and PGN formats, improved documentation, and enhancements to the API.
