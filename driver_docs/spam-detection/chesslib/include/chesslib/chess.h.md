Defines data structures and functions for managing and playing a chess game, including move validation.

# Purpose
The code defines a C module for managing a chess game, providing functionality to create, initialize, and manipulate a chess game state. It includes the `chess` structure, which holds the current legal moves, terminal state, board history, move history, and repetition count. The module offers functions to create a new chess game, either from scratch or from a given FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) string, and to free the resources associated with a chess game. It also provides functions to play and undo moves, check the game's terminal state, and retrieve various game-related data such as the current board, legal moves, and move history.

The module includes several utility functions that mirror operations available in the `board` structure, such as retrieving the piece at a specific square, the current player's color, and castling rights. It also provides functions to check if a position is in check or if a square is attacked. Additionally, the module supports draw claims based on the 50-move rule and threefold repetition. Internal functions update the game state after each move, ensuring that the legal moves, repetition count, and terminal state are current. The module is intended to be used as part of a larger chess application, interfacing with other components through the defined functions and data structures.
