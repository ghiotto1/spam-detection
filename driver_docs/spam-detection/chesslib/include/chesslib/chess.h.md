Defines data structures and functions for managing and playing a chess game, including move validation.

# Purpose
The code defines a C header file for managing a chess game. It provides a structured way to represent and manipulate the state of a chess game, including the board, legal moves, and game history. The file includes definitions for a `chess` struct, which encapsulates the current legal moves, terminal state, board history, move history, and the number of repetitions of the current board position. The `terminalState` enumeration defines various end-game conditions, such as checkmate and different types of draws.

The file declares functions for creating, initializing, and freeing a chess game, as well as functions to retrieve various aspects of the game state, such as the current board, legal moves, and terminal state. It also includes functions to play and undo moves, check for check conditions, and manage draw claims. Additionally, the file provides utility functions that mirror operations on the board, such as getting the piece at a specific square and retrieving the current player's turn. The code is intended to be used as part of a larger chess application, providing a public API for interacting with the chess game state.
