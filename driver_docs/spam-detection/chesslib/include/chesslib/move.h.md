Defines structures and functions for chess moves, including UCI notation conversion.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines structures and functions for handling chess moves. It includes the necessary headers for square and piece definitions, which are likely part of a chess library. The `move` structure represents a chess move, including the starting square (`from`), the destination square (`to`), and an optional `promotion` piece type. The file declares functions to create moves ([`moveSq`](<#movesq>) and [`movePromote`](<#movepromote>)), compare two moves for equality ([`moveEq`](<#moveeq>)), and convert moves to and from UCI (Universal Chess Interface) notation ([`moveGetUci`](<#movegetuci>) and [`moveFromUci`](<#movefromuci>)). The [`moveGetUci`](<#movegetuci>) function returns a dynamically allocated string that must be freed by the caller.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `chesslib/square.h`
- `chesslib/piece.h`


# Data Structures

---
### move
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``from``: The starting square of the move.
    - ``to``: The destination square of the move.
    - ``promotion``: The type of piece to promote to, if applicable.
- **Description**: Represents a chess move, including the starting and destination squares, and an optional piece promotion type.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### moveSq<!-- {{#callable_declaration:moveSq}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/move.h#L18>)

Creates a move from one square to another without promotion.
- **Description**: Use this function to create a move between two squares on a chessboard when no piece promotion is involved. This function is useful in scenarios where a piece is moved from one location to another without changing its type, such as moving a pawn forward without reaching the promotion rank. Ensure that the `from` and `to` parameters represent valid squares on the chessboard.
- **Inputs**:
    - `from`: The starting square of the move. Must be a valid square on the chessboard.
    - `to`: The destination square of the move. Must be a valid square on the chessboard.
- **Output**: Returns a `move` structure representing the move from the `from` square to the `to` square without promotion.
- **See Also**: [`moveSq`](<../../src/chesslib/move.c.md#movesq>)  (Implementation)


---
### movePromote<!-- {{#callable_declaration:movePromote}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/move.h#L19>)

Creates a move with a promotion.
- **Description**: Use this function to create a chess move that includes a promotion. This is necessary when a pawn reaches the opposite end of the board and must be promoted to another piece type. Ensure that the `from` and `to` parameters represent valid squares on the chessboard, and the `promotion` parameter represents a valid piece type for promotion. The function returns a `move` structure initialized with the specified parameters.
- **Inputs**:
    - `from`: The starting square of the move. Must be a valid square on the chessboard.
    - `to`: The destination square of the move. Must be a valid square on the chessboard.
    - `promotion`: The type of piece to promote to. Must be a valid piece type for promotion.
- **Output**: A `move` structure initialized with the specified `from`, `to`, and `promotion` values.
- **See Also**: [`movePromote`](<../../src/chesslib/move.c.md#movepromote>)  (Implementation)


---
### moveEq<!-- {{#callable_declaration:moveEq}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/move.h#L21>)

Compares two chess moves for equality.
- **Description**: Use this function to determine if two chess moves are identical. It compares the starting and ending squares of the moves, as well as any promotion piece involved. This function is useful when you need to check if two moves are the same in terms of their effect on the chessboard. Ensure that the `move` structures provided are valid and initialized before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `m1`: The first move to compare. Must be a valid and initialized `move` structure.
    - `m2`: The second move to compare. Must be a valid and initialized `move` structure.
- **Output**: Returns a non-zero value if the moves are equal, otherwise returns zero.
- **See Also**: [`moveEq`](<../../src/chesslib/move.c.md#moveeq>)  (Implementation)


---
### moveGetUci<!-- {{#callable_declaration:moveGetUci}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/move.h#L24>)

Converts a chess move to UCI notation.
- **Description**: Use this function to get the UCI (Universal Chess Interface) notation for a given chess move. The function allocates memory for the resulting string, which the caller must free after use. It handles both regular moves and promotion moves, appending the appropriate promotion piece letter in lowercase if applicable. Ensure that the input move is valid and initialized before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `m`: A `move` structure representing the chess move to convert. It must be a valid and initialized move, with `from` and `to` squares specified. If the move involves a promotion, the `promotion` field must contain the appropriate piece type.
- **Output**: A dynamically allocated string containing the UCI notation of the move. The caller is responsible for freeing this memory.
- **See Also**: [`moveGetUci`](<../../src/chesslib/move.c.md#movegetuci>)  (Implementation)


---
### moveFromUci<!-- {{#callable_declaration:moveFromUci}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/move.h#L25>)

Converts a UCI string to a move structure.
- **Description**: Use this function to convert a Universal Chess Interface (UCI) formatted string into a `move` structure. The function expects a string of at least four characters, representing the starting and ending squares in UCI format. An optional fifth character can specify a promotion piece type. If the fifth character is not present or does not match a valid promotion piece, the promotion field in the `move` structure will be set to `ptEmpty`. This function is useful for interpreting UCI commands in chess applications.
- **Inputs**:
    - `uci`: A pointer to a null-terminated string representing a move in UCI format. The string must be at least four characters long. The first two characters represent the starting square, and the next two represent the ending square. An optional fifth character can specify a promotion piece ('n', 'b', 'r', 'q', 'k'). The caller retains ownership of the string, and it must not be null.
- **Output**: Returns a `move` structure with the `from` and `to` fields set according to the UCI string, and the `promotion` field set based on the optional fifth character.
- **See Also**: [`moveFromUci`](<../../src/chesslib/move.c.md#movefromuci>)  (Implementation)
