Defines structures and functions for chess moves, including UCI notation conversion.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines structures and functions for handling chess moves. It includes the necessary headers for square and piece definitions from the `chesslib` library. The `move` structure represents a chess move, containing the starting square (`from`), the destination square (`to`), and an optional `promotion` piece type. The file declares functions to create moves ([`moveSq`](<#movesq>) and [`movePromote`](<#movepromote>)), compare two moves for equality ([`moveEq`](<#moveeq>)), convert a move to UCI (Universal Chess Interface) notation ([`moveGetUci`](<#movegetuci>)), and parse a move from UCI notation ([`moveFromUci`](<#movefromuci>)). The [`moveGetUci`](<#movegetuci>) function returns a dynamically allocated string that must be freed by the caller.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `chesslib/square.h`
- `chesslib/piece.h`


# Data Structures

---
### move
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``from``: The starting square of the move.
    - ``to``: The destination square of the move.
    - ``promotion``: The type of piece to promote to, if applicable.
- **Description**: Represents a chess move, including the starting and destination squares, and an optional piece promotion type.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### moveSq<!-- {{#callable_declaration:moveSq}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/move.h#L18>)

Creates a move from one square to another without promotion.
- **Description**: Use this function to create a move between two squares on a chessboard when no piece promotion is involved. This function is useful for standard moves where a piece moves from one square to another without changing its type. Ensure that the `from` and `to` parameters represent valid squares on the chessboard.
- **Inputs**:
    - `from`: The starting square of the move. Must be a valid square on the chessboard.
    - `to`: The destination square of the move. Must be a valid square on the chessboard.
- **Output**: Returns a `move` structure representing the move from the `from` square to the `to` square without promotion.
- **See Also**: [`moveSq`](<../../src/chesslib/move.c.md#movesq>)  (Implementation)


---
### movePromote<!-- {{#callable_declaration:movePromote}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/move.h#L19>)

Creates a move with a promotion.
- **Description**: Use this function to create a chess move that includes a promotion. This is necessary when a pawn reaches the opposite end of the board and is promoted to another piece, such as a queen, rook, bishop, or knight. Ensure that the `from` and `to` parameters represent valid squares on the chessboard, and the `promotion` parameter represents a valid piece type for promotion. The function returns a `move` structure that encapsulates the details of the move, including the promotion.
- **Inputs**:
    - `from`: The starting square of the move. Must be a valid square on the chessboard.
    - `to`: The destination square of the move. Must be a valid square on the chessboard.
    - `promotion`: The type of piece to which the pawn is promoted. Must be a valid piece type for promotion, such as queen, rook, bishop, or knight.
- **Output**: Returns a `move` structure containing the `from` and `to` squares and the `promotion` piece type.
- **See Also**: [`movePromote`](<../../src/chesslib/move.c.md#movepromote>)  (Implementation)


---
### moveEq<!-- {{#callable_declaration:moveEq}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/move.h#L21>)

Compares two chess moves for equality.
- **Description**: Use this function to check if two chess moves are identical. It compares the starting and ending squares of the moves and checks if the promotion piece type is the same. This function is useful when you need to determine if two moves are equivalent in a chess game context. Ensure that the `move` structures provided are valid and initialized before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `m1`: A `move` structure representing the first chess move to compare. Must be a valid and initialized `move` structure.
    - `m2`: A `move` structure representing the second chess move to compare. Must be a valid and initialized `move` structure.
- **Output**: Returns a `uint8_t` value of 1 if the moves are equal, or 0 if they are not.
- **See Also**: [`moveEq`](<../../src/chesslib/move.c.md#moveeq>)  (Implementation)


---
### moveGetUci<!-- {{#callable_declaration:moveGetUci}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/move.h#L24>)

Converts a chess move to UCI notation.
- **Description**: Use this function to get the UCI (Universal Chess Interface) notation for a given chess move. The function allocates memory for the resulting string, which the caller must free after use to prevent memory leaks. It handles both regular moves and promotion moves, appending the appropriate promotion piece letter in lowercase if applicable. Ensure that the input move is valid and initialized before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `m`: A `move` structure representing the chess move to convert. It must be a valid and initialized move, with `from` and `to` squares specified. If the move involves a promotion, the `promotion` field must contain the type of piece to promote to.
- **Output**: A pointer to a dynamically allocated string containing the UCI notation of the move. The caller is responsible for freeing this memory.
- **See Also**: [`moveGetUci`](<../../src/chesslib/move.c.md#movegetuci>)  (Implementation)


---
### moveFromUci<!-- {{#callable_declaration:moveFromUci}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/move.h#L25>)

Converts a UCI string to a move structure.
- **Description**: Use this function to convert a Universal Chess Interface (UCI) string into a `move` structure. The UCI string must be at least four characters long, representing the starting and ending squares in algebraic notation. An optional fifth character can specify a promotion piece. If the fifth character is not present or is invalid, the promotion field in the `move` structure will be set to `ptEmpty`. Ensure the input string is correctly formatted to avoid unexpected results.
- **Inputs**:
    - `uci`: A pointer to a null-terminated string representing a move in UCI format. The string must be at least four characters long. The caller retains ownership and must ensure the string is valid and properly formatted.
- **Output**: Returns a `move` structure with the `from` and `to` fields set according to the UCI string, and the `promotion` field set based on the optional fifth character.
- **See Also**: [`moveFromUci`](<../../src/chesslib/move.c.md#movefromuci>)  (Implementation)
