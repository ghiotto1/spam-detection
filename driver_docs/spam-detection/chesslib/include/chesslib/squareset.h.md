Defines a 64-bit square set for chessboard states with functions to set and get square values.

# Purpose
This header file defines a data structure and functions for managing a set of squares on a chessboard using a 64-bit integer. The `sqSet` type is a `uint64_t` that represents the state of each square on the board as either "on" or "off." The file includes function declarations for [`sqSetSet`](<#sqsetset>) and [`sqSetGet`](<#sqsetget>), which are used to set and retrieve the state of a specific square, respectively. The file also includes a `TODO` comment suggesting the addition of conditional typedefs for systems that do not support `uint64_t`, allowing them to use an alternative structure.

### sqSetSet<!-- {{#callable_declaration:sqSetSet}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/squareset.h#L14>)

Sets the state of a square in a square set.
- **Description**: Use this function to change the state of a specific square in a square set to either "on" or "off". This function does nothing if the square is invalid. Ensure that the square set pointer is valid and that the square is not `SQ_INVALID` before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ss`: A pointer to a `sqSet` that represents the set of squares. Must not be null. The function modifies the square set based on the given square and value.
    - `s`: The square to modify within the square set. Must not be `SQ_INVALID`. If `SQ_INVALID`, the function does nothing.
    - `value`: A `uint8_t` value indicating the desired state of the square. Use a non-zero value to set the square "on" and zero to set it "off".
- **Output**: None
- **See Also**: [`sqSetSet`](<../../src/chesslib/squareset.c.md#sqsetset>)  (Implementation)

### sqSetGet<!-- {{#callable_declaration:sqSetGet}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/squareset.h#L15>)

Retrieves the state of a square in a square set.
- **Description**: Use this function to check if a specific square in a square set is active or inactive. The function requires a valid square set and a valid square identifier. If the square identifier is invalid, the function returns 0. This function does not modify the square set or the square identifier.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ss`: A pointer to a `sqSet`, which is a 64-bit number representing the state of squares on a board. Must not be null.
    - `s`: A `sq` representing the square to check. Must be a valid square identifier. If it is `SQ_INVALID`, the function returns 0.
- **Output**: Returns 1 if the square is active in the set, or 0 if it is inactive or if the square identifier is invalid.
- **See Also**: [`sqSetGet`](<../../src/chesslib/squareset.c.md#sqsetget>)  (Implementation)
