Defines a 64-bit square set for chessboard states with functions to set and get square values.

# Purpose
This header file defines a data structure and functions for managing a set of squares on a chessboard. The `sqSet` type is a 64-bit integer that represents the state of each square on the board as either "on" or "off." The file includes function declarations for [`sqSetSet`](<#sqsetset>) and [`sqSetGet`](<#sqsetget>), which are used to set and retrieve the state of a specific square, respectively. The file also includes a `TODO` comment indicating a future enhancement to support systems that do not have `uint64_t` by using an alternative data structure. The file uses the `#pragma once` directive to prevent multiple inclusions.

### sqSetSet<!-- {{#callable_declaration:sqSetSet}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/squareset.h#L14>)

Sets the state of a square in a square set.
- **Description**: Use this function to change the state of a specific square in a square set to either "on" or "off". The function requires a valid square identifier and a pointer to a square set. If the square identifier is invalid, the function does nothing. This function is useful for managing the state of squares on a chessboard, where each square can be independently toggled.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ss`: A pointer to a `sqSet`, which is a 64-bit number representing the state of squares. Must not be null. The function modifies the square set pointed to by this parameter.
    - `s`: A square identifier of type `sq`. Must be a valid square; otherwise, the function does nothing.
    - `value`: A `uint8_t` value indicating the desired state of the square. Use a non-zero value to set the square "on" and zero to set it "off".
- **Output**: None
- **See Also**: [`sqSetSet`](<../../src/chesslib/squareset.c.md#sqsetset>)  (Implementation)

### sqSetGet<!-- {{#callable_declaration:sqSetGet}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/squareset.h#L15>)

Retrieves the state of a square in a square set.
- **Description**: Use this function to check if a specific square in a square set is active or inactive. The function requires a valid square identifier and a pointer to a square set. It returns the state of the square as either active (1) or inactive (0). If the square identifier is invalid, the function returns 0. Ensure that the square set pointer is not null before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ss`: A pointer to a `sqSet`, which is a 64-bit number representing the state of squares on a board. Must not be null.
    - `s`: A `sq` type representing the square to check. Must be a valid square identifier; otherwise, the function returns 0.
- **Output**: Returns 1 if the square is active, 0 if it is inactive or if the square identifier is invalid.
- **See Also**: [`sqSetGet`](<../../src/chesslib/squareset.c.md#sqsetget>)  (Implementation)
