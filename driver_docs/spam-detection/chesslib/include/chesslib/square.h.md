Defines a square struct and functions for chessboard square operations, including creation and comparison.

# Purpose
This C header file defines a data structure and functions for handling chessboard squares. The `sq` struct represents a square on a chessboard using two `uint8_t` values, `file` and `rank`, which range from 1 to 8. The file provides several utility functions: [`sqI`](<#sqi>) and [`sqS`](<#sqs>) create a square from integer coordinates or a Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN) string, respectively; [`sqIndex`](<#sqindex>) and [`sqGetIndex`](<#sqgetindex>) convert between a square and a linear index from 0 to 63; [`sqGetStr`](<#sqgetstr>) returns the SAN string for a square; [`sqIsDark`](<#sqisdark>) determines if a square is dark-colored; and [`sqEq`](<#sqeq>) compares two squares for equality. The macro `SQ_INVALID` defines an invalid square with both `file` and `rank` set to -1.

# Data Structures

---
### sq
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``file``: Stores the file component of a chess square, ranging from 1 to 8.
    - ``rank``: Stores the rank component of a chess square, ranging from 1 to 8.
- **Description**: Represents a square on a chessboard using two 8-bit unsigned integers, `file` and `rank`, which correspond to the horizontal and vertical positions on the board, respectively.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### sqI<!-- {{#callable_declaration:sqI}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/square.h#L20>)

Creates a square from file and rank values.
- **Description**: Use this function to create a square structure from given file and rank values. The function expects both file and rank to be within the range of 1 to 8, inclusive. If either value is outside this range, the function returns a predefined invalid square constant. This function is useful for initializing square structures in applications that require chessboard-like coordinate systems.
- **Inputs**:
    - `file`: The file component of the square, representing a column on a chessboard. Must be in the range 1 to 8. If outside this range, the function returns `SQ_INVALID`.
    - `rank`: The rank component of the square, representing a row on a chessboard. Must be in the range 1 to 8. If outside this range, the function returns `SQ_INVALID`.
- **Output**: Returns a `sq` structure with the specified file and rank if both are valid; otherwise, returns `SQ_INVALID`.
- **See Also**: [`sqI`](<../../src/chesslib/square.c.md#sqi>)  (Implementation)


---
### sqS<!-- {{#callable_declaration:sqS}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/square.h#L22>)

Creates a square from a SAN square string.
- **Description**: Use this function to convert a Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN) square string, such as "e4", into a `sq` structure representing a chessboard square. The input string must be exactly two characters long, with the first character being a lowercase letter from 'a' to 'h' representing the file, and the second character being a digit from '1' to '8' representing the rank. If the input string does not meet these criteria, the function returns `SQ_INVALID`. This function is useful for parsing chess moves or positions from SAN notation.
- **Inputs**:
    - `str`: A pointer to a null-terminated string representing a SAN square. The string must be exactly two characters long, with the first character in the range 'a' to 'h' and the second character in the range '1' to '8'. The caller retains ownership of the string. If the string is invalid, the function returns `SQ_INVALID`.
- **Output**: Returns a `sq` structure representing the chessboard square if the input is valid. Returns `SQ_INVALID` if the input string is invalid.
- **See Also**: [`sqS`](<../../src/chesslib/square.c.md#sqs>)  (Implementation)


---
### sqIndex<!-- {{#callable_declaration:sqIndex}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/square.h#L25>)

Converts an index to a square.
- **Description**: Use this function to convert an index in the range 0 to 63 into a square representation. The index corresponds to a position on a chessboard, where 0 represents the square 'a1' and 63 represents 'h8'. If the index is outside the valid range, the function returns an invalid square indicator. This function is useful for translating between linear index representations and two-dimensional board coordinates.
- **Inputs**:
    - `index`: An unsigned 8-bit integer representing the index of the square. Valid values are from 0 to 63. If the value is outside this range, the function returns an invalid square.
- **Output**: Returns a `sq` struct representing the square corresponding to the given index, or `SQ_INVALID` if the index is out of range.
- **See Also**: [`sqIndex`](<../../src/chesslib/square.c.md#sqindex>)  (Implementation)


---
### sqGetIndex<!-- {{#callable_declaration:sqGetIndex}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/square.h#L26>)

Converts a square to its corresponding index.
- **Description**: Use this function to convert a chessboard square, represented by the `sq` struct, into a zero-based index ranging from 0 to 63. This index corresponds to the position on a standard 8x8 chessboard, where 0 represents square a1 and 63 represents square h8. The function expects the `file` and `rank` fields of the `sq` struct to be within the range of 1 to 8. If either field is outside this range, the function returns -1, indicating an invalid square.
- **Inputs**:
    - `s`: A struct of type `sq` representing a chessboard square. The `file` and `rank` fields must be in the range 1 to 8. If these fields are outside this range, the function returns -1.
- **Output**: Returns a `uint8_t` representing the zero-based index of the square on the chessboard, or -1 if the input is invalid.
- **See Also**: [`sqGetIndex`](<../../src/chesslib/square.c.md#sqgetindex>)  (Implementation)


---
### sqGetStr<!-- {{#callable_declaration:sqGetStr}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/square.h#L29>)

Gets the SAN string representation of a square.
- **Description**: Use this function to obtain the Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN) string for a given square. This function is useful when you need a human-readable representation of a square in a chessboard context. The function expects a valid square and returns a string that corresponds to the square's position. If the square index is out of the valid range (greater than 63), the function returns a placeholder string "##". The returned string does not require deallocation.
- **Inputs**:
    - `s`: A `sq` structure representing a square on a chessboard. The `file` and `rank` fields must be in the range 1-8. If the square index derived from `s` is greater than 63, the function returns "##".
- **Output**: A constant character pointer to the SAN string representing the square. If the square index is invalid, returns "##".
- **See Also**: [`sqGetStr`](<../../src/chesslib/square.c.md#sqgetstr>)  (Implementation)

### sqIsDark<!-- {{#callable_declaration:sqIsDark}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/square.h#L32>)

Returns 1 if the square is dark-colored, otherwise returns 0.
- **Description**: Use this function to determine the color of a square on a chessboard. It returns 1 if the square is dark-colored and 0 if it is light-colored. This function expects a valid square structure as input, where both the file and rank are within the range of 1 to 8. Ensure that the square is valid before calling this function to avoid undefined behavior.
- **Inputs**:
    - `s`: A square structure with `file` and `rank` fields, both expected to be in the range 1 to 8. The function does not handle invalid square values, so ensure the square is valid before calling.
- **Output**: Returns 1 if the square is dark-colored, otherwise returns 0.
- **See Also**: [`sqIsDark`](<../../src/chesslib/square.c.md#sqisdark>)  (Implementation)


---
### sqEq<!-- {{#callable_declaration:sqEq}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/square.h#L35>)

Compares two squares for equality.
- **Description**: Use this function to check if two chessboard squares are the same. It compares the file and rank of each square. If either square has a file or rank outside the range of 1 to 8, it is considered invalid and set to `SQ_INVALID`. The function then returns whether the two squares are equal.
- **Inputs**:
    - `s1`: The first square to compare. The `file` and `rank` must be in the range 1 to 8. If not, it is set to `SQ_INVALID`.
    - `s2`: The second square to compare. The `file` and `rank` must be in the range 1 to 8. If not, it is set to `SQ_INVALID`.
- **Output**: Returns 1 if the squares are equal, 0 otherwise.
- **See Also**: [`sqEq`](<../../src/chesslib/square.c.md#sqeq>)  (Implementation)
