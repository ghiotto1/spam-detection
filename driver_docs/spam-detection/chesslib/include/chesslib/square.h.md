Defines a square struct and functions for chessboard square operations, including creation and comparison.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines a structure and functions for handling chessboard squares. The `sq` structure represents a square on a chessboard using two `uint8_t` fields, `file` and `rank`, which are expected to be in the range of 1 to 8. The file provides several functions for creating and manipulating these squares, including [`sqI`](<#sqi>) for creating a square from two integers, [`sqS`](<#sqs>) for creating a square from a Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN) string, and [`sqIndex`](<#sqindex>) and [`sqGetIndex`](<#sqgetindex>) for converting between a square and a linear index. Additionally, the file includes utility functions such as [`sqGetStr`](<#sqgetstr>) to obtain the SAN string representation of a square, [`sqIsDark`](<#sqisdark>) to determine if a square is dark-colored, and [`sqEq`](<#sqeq>) to compare two squares for equality. The macro `SQ_INVALID` is defined to represent an invalid square with both `file` and `rank` set to -1.

# Data Structures

---
### sq
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``file``: Represents the file of a square on a chessboard, ranging from 1 to 8.
    - ``rank``: Represents the rank of a square on a chessboard, ranging from 1 to 8.
- **Description**: Represents a square on a chessboard using two 8-bit unsigned integers, `file` and `rank`, which correspond to the horizontal and vertical positions on the board, respectively.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### sqI<!-- {{#callable_declaration:sqI}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/square.h#L20>)

Creates a square from file and rank values.
- **Description**: Use this function to create a `sq` structure representing a square on a chessboard, given specific file and rank values. The function expects both file and rank to be within the range of 1 to 8, inclusive. If either value is outside this range, the function returns `SQ_INVALID`, indicating an invalid square. This function is useful for converting file and rank coordinates into a `sq` structure for further operations.
- **Inputs**:
    - `file`: The file of the square, which must be an integer between 1 and 8, inclusive. If the value is outside this range, the function returns `SQ_INVALID`.
    - `rank`: The rank of the square, which must be an integer between 1 and 8, inclusive. If the value is outside this range, the function returns `SQ_INVALID`.
- **Output**: Returns a `sq` structure with the specified file and rank if both are valid; otherwise, returns `SQ_INVALID`.
- **See Also**: [`sqI`](<../../src/chesslib/square.c.md#sqi>)  (Implementation)


---
### sqS<!-- {{#callable_declaration:sqS}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/square.h#L22>)

Creates a square from a SAN square string.
- **Description**: Use this function to convert a string representing a square in Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN) into a `sq` struct. The input string must be exactly two characters long, where the first character is a lowercase letter from 'a' to 'h' representing the file, and the second character is a digit from '1' to '8' representing the rank. If the input string does not meet these criteria, the function returns `SQ_INVALID`. This function is useful for interpreting chess board positions from SAN strings.
- **Inputs**:
    - `str`: A pointer to a null-terminated string representing a square in SAN format. The string must be exactly two characters long, with the first character in the range 'a' to 'h' and the second character in the range '1' to '8'. The caller retains ownership of the string. If the string is invalid, the function returns `SQ_INVALID`.
- **Output**: Returns a `sq` struct representing the square if the input is valid, or `SQ_INVALID` if the input is invalid.
- **See Also**: [`sqS`](<../../src/chesslib/square.c.md#sqs>)  (Implementation)


---
### sqIndex<!-- {{#callable_declaration:sqIndex}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/square.h#L25>)

Converts an index to a square.
- **Description**: Use this function to convert an index in the range of 0 to 63 into a square representation. This is useful for mapping a linear index to a two-dimensional board coordinate. The function returns an invalid square if the index is outside the valid range. Ensure that the index is within the specified range to avoid receiving an invalid square.
- **Inputs**:
    - `index`: An unsigned 8-bit integer representing the index to convert. Valid values are from 0 to 63. If the value is outside this range, the function returns an invalid square.
- **Output**: Returns a `sq` structure representing the square corresponding to the given index. If the index is invalid, returns `SQ_INVALID`.
- **See Also**: [`sqIndex`](<../../src/chesslib/square.c.md#sqindex>)  (Implementation)


---
### sqGetIndex<!-- {{#callable_declaration:sqGetIndex}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/square.h#L26>)

Converts a square to its corresponding index.
- **Description**: Use this function to get the index of a square on a chessboard, where the index ranges from 0 to 63. The function expects the square to have valid file and rank values, each between 1 and 8 inclusive. If the square is outside this range, the function returns -1, indicating an invalid square.
- **Inputs**:
    - `s`: A `sq` structure representing a square on a chessboard. The `file` and `rank` fields must be in the range 1 to 8. If these values are outside the valid range, the function returns -1.
- **Output**: Returns an `uint8_t` index from 0 to 63 if the square is valid, or -1 if the square is invalid.
- **See Also**: [`sqGetIndex`](<../../src/chesslib/square.c.md#sqgetindex>)  (Implementation)


---
### sqGetStr<!-- {{#callable_declaration:sqGetStr}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/square.h#L29>)

Gets the SAN string for a given square.
- **Description**: Use this function to obtain the Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN) string that represents a given chessboard square. The function expects a valid `sq` structure as input, where the `file` and `rank` fields are within the range of 1 to 8. If the square is invalid or its index exceeds 63, the function returns a placeholder string "##". This function does not allocate memory for the returned string, so there is no need to free it.
- **Inputs**:
    - `s`: A `sq` structure representing a chessboard square. The `file` and `rank` fields must be in the range 1 to 8. If the square is invalid or its index is greater than 63, the function returns "##".
- **Output**: A pointer to a constant character string representing the SAN of the square, or "##" if the square is invalid.
- **See Also**: [`sqGetStr`](<../../src/chesslib/square.c.md#sqgetstr>)  (Implementation)


---
### sqIsDark<!-- {{#callable_declaration:sqIsDark}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/square.h#L32>)

Determines if a square is dark-colored.
- **Description**: Use this function to check if a given square on a chessboard is dark-colored. The function expects a valid `sq` structure with `file` and `rank` values in the range of 1 to 8. It returns 1 if the square is dark and 0 if it is light. Ensure that the `sq` structure is properly initialized before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `s`: A structure representing a square on a chessboard, with `file` and `rank` values in the range 1 to 8. The function does not handle invalid values and expects the input to be valid.
- **Output**: Returns 1 if the square is dark-colored, otherwise returns 0.
- **See Also**: [`sqIsDark`](<../../src/chesslib/square.c.md#sqisdark>)  (Implementation)


---
### sqEq<!-- {{#callable_declaration:sqEq}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/square.h#L35>)

Compares two squares for equality.
- **Description**: Use this function to check if two chessboard squares are equal. It compares the file and rank of each square. If either square has a file or rank outside the range of 1 to 8, it is considered invalid and set to `SQ_INVALID`. The function returns true if both squares are equal in terms of file and rank, and false otherwise.
- **Inputs**:
    - `s1`: The first square to compare. The `file` and `rank` must be in the range 1 to 8. If outside this range, it is set to `SQ_INVALID`.
    - `s2`: The second square to compare. The `file` and `rank` must be in the range 1 to 8. If outside this range, it is set to `SQ_INVALID`.
- **Output**: Returns 1 if the squares are equal, and 0 if they are not.
- **See Also**: [`sqEq`](<../../src/chesslib/square.c.md#sqeq>)  (Implementation)
