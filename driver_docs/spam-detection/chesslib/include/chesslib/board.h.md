Defines a chess board structure and functions for board initialization, manipulation, and state evaluation.

# Purpose
This code defines a C header file for managing a chess board state. It provides structures and functions to initialize, manipulate, and evaluate chess board configurations. The `board` structure is central to this file, representing the state of a chess game, including the positions of pieces, the current player, castling rights, en passant targets, and move counters. The file includes constants for the initial board setup in Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) and bitmask values for castling rights.

The functions in this file allow for creating and initializing a board, either from scratch or from a FEN string. They also provide functionality to set and get pieces on the board, generate possible moves, and check for conditions such as check, checkmate, and insufficient material. Additionally, the file includes functions to play moves on the board, compare board states, and convert the board state back to a FEN string. This header file is intended to be used in conjunction with other components of a chess library, as indicated by the inclusion of headers like `chesslib/square.h`, `chesslib/piece.h`, and `chesslib/movelist.h`.

### boardCreate<!-- {{#callable_declaration:boardCreate}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/board.h#L31>)

Allocates and initializes a chess board to the starting position.
- **Description**: Use this function to create a new chess board initialized to the standard starting position. The function allocates memory for the board structure and sets up the pieces according to the initial FEN string. It is important to free the returned pointer when it is no longer needed to avoid memory leaks. The function returns a null pointer if the board cannot be created, indicating a failure in allocation or initialization.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Output**: A pointer to a newly allocated `board` structure initialized to the starting position, or null if the creation fails.
- **See Also**: [`boardCreate`](<../../src/chesslib/board.c.md#boardcreate>)  (Implementation)


---
### boardCreateFromFen<!-- {{#callable_declaration:boardCreateFromFen}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/board.h#L32>)

Allocates and initializes a chess board from a FEN string.
- **Description**: Use this function to create a new chess board initialized to a specific position described by a FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) string. The function allocates memory for a new `board` structure and initializes it based on the provided FEN string. If the FEN string is invalid or initialization fails, the function returns `NULL`. The caller is responsible for freeing the allocated memory when it is no longer needed. This function is useful for setting up a board to a specific state for analysis or gameplay.
- **Inputs**:
    - `fen`: A null-terminated string representing the board position in FEN format. The string must be valid and correctly formatted according to FEN specifications. If the string is invalid, the function returns `NULL`. The caller retains ownership of the string.
- **Output**: A pointer to a newly allocated `board` structure initialized to the position described by the FEN string, or `NULL` if initialization fails.
- **See Also**: [`boardCreateFromFen`](<../../src/chesslib/board.c.md#boardcreatefromfen>)  (Implementation)


---
### boardInitInPlace<!-- {{#callable_declaration:boardInitInPlace}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/board.h#L35>)

Initializes a chess board to the standard starting position.
- **Description**: Use this function to set up a chess board to the standard initial position for a new game. This function modifies the provided `board` structure directly and does not allocate new memory. Ensure that the `board` pointer is valid and points to an existing `board` structure before calling this function. This function is useful when you want to reset a board to the starting position without creating a new board instance.
- **Inputs**:
    - `b`: A pointer to a `board` structure that will be initialized. Must not be null and must point to a valid `board` structure. The function does not check for null pointers, so passing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior.
- **Output**: None
