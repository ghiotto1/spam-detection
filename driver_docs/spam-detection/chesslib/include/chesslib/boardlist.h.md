Defines data structures and functions for managing a linked list of chess boards.

# Purpose
This code defines a simple C header file for managing a linked list of chess boards. It includes the necessary structure definitions and function prototypes for creating and manipulating a `boardList`, which is a linked list of `boardListNode` elements. Each `boardListNode` contains a pointer to a `board` and a pointer to the next node in the list. The `boardList` structure maintains pointers to the head and tail of the list, as well as the size of the list. The file provides function prototypes for creating a new list or node, adding a board to the list, retrieving a board by index, undoing the last addition, and freeing the entire list.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `stddef.h`
- `chesslib/board.h`


# Data Structures

---
### boardListNode
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``board``: A pointer to a `board` structure.
    - ``next``: A pointer to the next `boardListNode` in the list.
- **Description**: Represents a node in a linked list that stores a pointer to a `board` and a pointer to the next node in the list, enabling traversal through the list.


---
### boardList
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``head``: A pointer to the first node in the list.
    - ``tail``: A pointer to the last node in the list.
    - ``size``: The number of nodes in the list.
- **Description**: Represents a linked list of `boardListNode` elements, where each node contains a `board` and a pointer to the next node. The `head` and `tail` pointers allow for efficient insertion and removal of nodes at both ends of the list, while the `size` member keeps track of the total number of nodes in the list.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### boardListCreate<!-- {{#callable_declaration:boardListCreate}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/boardlist.h#L26>)

Creates an empty board list.
- **Description**: Use this function to create a new, empty `boardList` structure. This function allocates memory for the list and initializes its internal pointers and size to represent an empty list. Ensure to call this function before performing any operations on a `boardList`. After use, free the allocated memory with `boardListFree` to prevent memory leaks.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to a newly allocated `boardList` structure, or `NULL` if memory allocation fails.
- **See Also**: [`boardListCreate`](<../../src/chesslib/boardlist.c.md#boardlistcreate>)  (Implementation)


---
### boardListNodeCreate<!-- {{#callable_declaration:boardListNodeCreate}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/boardlist.h#L27>)

Creates a new board list node with a specified board.
- **Description**: Use this function to create a new node for a linked list of boards. The function allocates memory for a new `boardListNode` and initializes it with the given `board` pointer. The `next` pointer of the node is set to `NULL`, indicating that it is the last node in the list. Ensure that the `board` pointer provided is valid and that you manage the memory of the created node to prevent memory leaks.
- **Inputs**:
    - `b`: A pointer to a `board` structure. This pointer must be valid and is assigned to the `board` field of the new node. The caller retains ownership of the `board`.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the newly created `boardListNode`. If memory allocation fails, the behavior is undefined.
- **See Also**: [`boardListNodeCreate`](<../../src/chesslib/boardlist.c.md#boardlistnodecreate>)  (Implementation)


---
### boardListAdd<!-- {{#callable_declaration:boardListAdd}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/boardlist.h#L30>)

Adds a board to the end of the board list.
- **Description**: Use this function to append a new board to the end of an existing `boardList`. This function increases the size of the list by one. Ensure that the `boardList` is properly initialized before calling this function. The function does not handle null pointers for the `list` or `b` parameters, so ensure these are valid before calling.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a `boardList` structure where the board will be added. Must not be null and must point to a valid `boardList`.
    - `b`: A pointer to a `board` structure that will be added to the list. Must not be null and must point to a valid `board`.
- **Output**: None
- **See Also**: [`boardListAdd`](<../../src/chesslib/boardlist.c.md#boardlistadd>)  (Implementation)


---
### boardListGet<!-- {{#callable_declaration:boardListGet}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/boardlist.h#L31>)

Retrieves a board from the list at the specified index.
- **Description**: Use this function to access a specific board from a `boardList` by its index. The function assumes that the index is valid and within the bounds of the list. It starts from the head of the list and traverses nodes until it reaches the specified index. Ensure that the list is not empty and the index is less than the size of the list to avoid undefined behavior.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a `boardList` from which to retrieve the board. Must not be null, and the list should be properly initialized.
    - `index`: An unsigned integer representing the position in the list from which to retrieve the board. Must be less than the size of the list.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the `board` at the specified index in the list.
- **See Also**: [`boardListGet`](<../../src/chesslib/boardlist.c.md#boardlistget>)  (Implementation)


---
### boardListUndo<!-- {{#callable_declaration:boardListUndo}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/boardlist.h#L32>)

Removes the last node from a board list.
- **Description**: Use this function to remove the last node from a `boardList`. It decreases the size of the list by one and updates the `tail` pointer to the new last node. If the list is empty or the `head` is null, the function does nothing. This function must be called only on a valid `boardList` that has been initialized and populated with nodes.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a `boardList` structure. Must not be null. The function does nothing if `list` is null or if `list->head` is null.
- **Output**: None
- **See Also**: [`boardListUndo`](<../../src/chesslib/boardlist.c.md#boardlistundo>)  (Implementation)


---
### boardListFree<!-- {{#callable_declaration:boardListFree}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/boardlist.h#L35>)

Frees a board list and all its nodes.
- **Description**: Use this function to release all memory associated with a `boardList` and its nodes. This function must be called when the list is no longer needed to prevent memory leaks. Ensure that the `list` parameter is not null before calling this function. After execution, the `list` and its nodes are invalid and should not be accessed.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a `boardList` structure. Must not be null. The function will free all nodes and the list itself. If `list` is null, behavior is undefined.
- **Output**: None
- **See Also**: [`boardListFree`](<../../src/chesslib/boardlist.c.md#boardlistfree>)  (Implementation)
