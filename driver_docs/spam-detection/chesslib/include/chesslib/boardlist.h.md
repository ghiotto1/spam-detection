Defines data structures and functions for managing a linked list of chess boards.

# Purpose
This code defines a data structure and related operations for managing a list of chess boards. It includes the definition of two structures: `boardListNode`, which represents a node containing a pointer to a `board` and a pointer to the next node, and `boardList`, which maintains pointers to the head and tail of the list and tracks the list's size. The code provides functions to create a new `boardList` or `boardListNode`, add a board to the list, retrieve a board by index, undo the last addition, and free the entire list along with its nodes. The header file uses `#pragma once` to prevent multiple inclusions and includes the necessary header for size definitions and the `board` type.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `stddef.h`
- `chesslib/board.h`


# Data Structures

---
### boardListNode
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``board``: A pointer to a `board` structure.
    - ``next``: A pointer to the next `boardListNode` in the list.
- **Description**: Defines a node in a linked list that stores a pointer to a `board` and a pointer to the next node, enabling traversal through the list.


---
### boardList
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `head`: Pointer to the first node in the list.
    - `tail`: Pointer to the last node in the list.
    - `size`: Number of nodes in the list.
- **Description**: Stores a linked list of `boardListNode` elements, with pointers to the head and tail nodes, and tracks the total number of nodes in the list.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### boardListCreate<!-- {{#callable_declaration:boardListCreate}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/boardlist.h#L26>)

Creates an empty board list.
- **Description**: Use this function to create a new, empty `boardList` structure. This function allocates memory for the list and initializes its internal pointers and size to represent an empty list. Ensure to call this function before performing any operations on a `boardList`. After use, free the allocated memory with `boardListFree` to prevent memory leaks.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to a newly allocated `boardList` structure, or `NULL` if memory allocation fails.
- **See Also**: [`boardListCreate`](<../../src/chesslib/boardlist.c.md#boardlistcreate>)  (Implementation)


---
### boardListNodeCreate<!-- {{#callable_declaration:boardListNodeCreate}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/boardlist.h#L27>)

Creates a new board list node with a specified board.
- **Description**: Use this function to create a new node for a board list, initializing it with a given board. This function allocates memory for the node, sets its board pointer to the provided board, and initializes the next pointer to NULL. Ensure that the board pointer provided is valid and that you manage the memory of the created node to prevent memory leaks.
- **Inputs**:
    - `b`: A pointer to a `board` structure. This must be a valid pointer and not NULL. The function does not take ownership of the board, so the caller must manage its memory.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to a newly allocated `boardListNode` structure, or NULL if memory allocation fails.
- **See Also**: [`boardListNodeCreate`](<../../src/chesslib/boardlist.c.md#boardlistnodecreate>)  (Implementation)


---
### boardListAdd<!-- {{#callable_declaration:boardListAdd}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/boardlist.h#L30>)

Adds a board to the end of a board list.
- **Description**: Use this function to append a new board to the end of an existing `boardList`. This function increases the size of the list by one. Ensure that the `boardList` is properly initialized before calling this function. The function does not handle null pointers for the `list` or `b` parameters, so ensure they are valid before calling.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a `boardList` structure where the board will be added. Must not be null and must point to a valid `boardList`.
    - `b`: A pointer to a `board` structure that will be added to the list. Must not be null and must point to a valid `board`.
- **Output**: None
- **See Also**: [`boardListAdd`](<../../src/chesslib/boardlist.c.md#boardlistadd>)  (Implementation)


---
### boardListGet<!-- {{#callable_declaration:boardListGet}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/boardlist.h#L31>)

Retrieves a board from the list at the specified index.
- **Description**: Use this function to access a specific board from a `boardList` by its index. The index must be within the bounds of the list, meaning it should be less than the size of the list. If the index is out of bounds, the behavior is undefined. This function does not modify the list or the boards within it.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a `boardList` from which to retrieve the board. Must not be null, and the list should be properly initialized.
    - `index`: An unsigned integer representing the position of the board to retrieve. Must be less than the size of the list to avoid undefined behavior.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the `board` at the specified index in the list.
- **See Also**: [`boardListGet`](<../../src/chesslib/boardlist.c.md#boardlistget>)  (Implementation)


---
### boardListUndo<!-- {{#callable_declaration:boardListUndo}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/boardlist.h#L32>)

Removes the last node from a board list.
- **Description**: Use this function to remove the last node from a `boardList`. It decreases the size of the list by one. If the list is empty or the `list` parameter is `NULL`, the function does nothing. This function must be called only on a valid `boardList` that has been initialized and populated with nodes. It is important to ensure that the list is not empty before calling this function to avoid unnecessary operations.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a `boardList` structure. Must not be `NULL` and should point to a valid `boardList` that has been initialized. If `list` is `NULL` or the list is empty, the function does nothing.
- **Output**: None
- **See Also**: [`boardListUndo`](<../../src/chesslib/boardlist.c.md#boardlistundo>)  (Implementation)


---
### boardListFree<!-- {{#callable_declaration:boardListFree}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/boardlist.h#L35>)

Frees a board list and all its nodes.
- **Description**: Use this function to release all memory associated with a `boardList` and its nodes. Call this function when the `boardList` is no longer needed to prevent memory leaks. Ensure that the `list` parameter is not null before calling this function. This function deallocates each node in the list, including the `board` contained within each node, and finally deallocates the `boardList` itself.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to the `boardList` to free. Must not be null. The function will deallocate all nodes and their associated `board` objects, as well as the `boardList` structure itself.
- **Output**: None
- **See Also**: [`boardListFree`](<../../src/chesslib/boardlist.c.md#boardlistfree>)  (Implementation)
