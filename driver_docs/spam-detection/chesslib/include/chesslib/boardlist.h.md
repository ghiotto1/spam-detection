Data structures and functions for managing a linked list of chess boards.

# Purpose
The code defines a simple C header file for managing a linked list of chess boards. It includes the definition of two structures: `boardListNode`, which represents a node containing a pointer to a `board` and a pointer to the next node, and `boardList`, which represents the linked list with pointers to the head and tail nodes and a size attribute. The file declares functions for creating a new `boardList` or `boardListNode`, adding a board to the list, retrieving a board by index, undoing the last addition, and freeing the entire list. The header file includes necessary standard and custom headers to support these operations.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `stddef.h`
- `chesslib/board.h`


# Data Structures

---
### boardListNode
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``board``: A pointer to a `board` structure.
    - ``next``: A pointer to the next `boardListNode` in the list.
- **Description**: Represents a node in a linked list that stores a pointer to a `board` and a pointer to the next node in the list, enabling traversal through the list.


---
### boardList
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``head``: A pointer to the first node in the list.
    - ``tail``: A pointer to the last node in the list.
    - ``size``: The number of nodes in the list.
- **Description**: Represents a linked list of `boardListNode` elements, where each node contains a `board` and a pointer to the next node. The `head` and `tail` pointers allow for efficient insertion and removal of nodes at both ends of the list, while the `size` member keeps track of the total number of nodes in the list.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### boardListCreate<!-- {{#callable_declaration:boardListCreate}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/boardlist.h#L26>)

Creates an empty board list.
- **Description**: Use this function to create a new, empty `boardList` structure. This function allocates memory for the list and initializes its head, tail, and size to represent an empty list. Ensure to call this function before performing any operations on a `boardList`. The caller is responsible for freeing the allocated memory using `boardListFree` to prevent memory leaks.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to a newly allocated `boardList` structure, or `NULL` if memory allocation fails.
- **See Also**: [`boardListCreate`](<../../src/chesslib/boardlist.c.md#boardlistcreate>)  (Implementation)


---
### boardListNodeCreate<!-- {{#callable_declaration:boardListNodeCreate}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/boardlist.h#L27>)

Creates a new board list node with a specified board.
- **Description**: Use this function to create a new node for a linked list of boards. The function allocates memory for a new `boardListNode` and assigns the provided `board` pointer to it. The `next` pointer of the node is initialized to `NULL`, indicating that it is the last node in the list. Ensure that the `board` pointer provided is valid and that you manage the memory of the created node to prevent memory leaks.
- **Inputs**:
    - `b`: A pointer to a `board` structure. This pointer must be valid and is assigned to the `board` field of the new node. The caller retains ownership of the `board` pointer.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the newly created `boardListNode`. If memory allocation fails, the behavior is undefined.
- **See Also**: [`boardListNodeCreate`](<../../src/chesslib/boardlist.c.md#boardlistnodecreate>)  (Implementation)


---
### boardListAdd<!-- {{#callable_declaration:boardListAdd}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/boardlist.h#L30>)

Adds a board to the end of a board list.
- **Description**: Use this function to append a new board to the end of an existing `boardList`. This function increases the size of the list by one. Ensure that the `boardList` is properly initialized before calling this function. The function does not handle null pointers for the `list` or `b` parameters, so ensure they are valid before calling.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a `boardList` structure where the board will be added. Must not be null and must point to a valid `boardList`.
    - `b`: A pointer to a `board` structure to add to the list. Must not be null and must point to a valid `board`.
- **Output**: None
- **See Also**: [`boardListAdd`](<../../src/chesslib/boardlist.c.md#boardlistadd>)  (Implementation)


---
### boardListGet<!-- {{#callable_declaration:boardListGet}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/boardlist.h#L31>)

Retrieves a board from the list at the specified index.
- **Description**: Use this function to get a pointer to a `board` from a `boardList` at a specific index. The index must be within the bounds of the list, meaning it should be less than the size of the list. If the index is out of bounds, the behavior is undefined. Ensure that the list is not null before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a `boardList` from which to retrieve the board. Must not be null.
    - `index`: An unsigned integer representing the position in the list from which to retrieve the board. Must be less than the size of the list.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to the `board` at the specified index in the list.
- **See Also**: [`boardListGet`](<../../src/chesslib/boardlist.c.md#boardlistget>)  (Implementation)


---
### boardListUndo<!-- {{#callable_declaration:boardListUndo}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/boardlist.h#L32>)

Removes the last node from the board list.
- **Description**: Use this function to remove the last node from a `boardList`. It decreases the size of the list by one and updates the `tail` pointer to the new last node. If the list is empty or the `list` parameter is `NULL`, the function does nothing. This function must be called only on a valid `boardList` that has been initialized and populated with nodes.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a `boardList` structure. Must not be `NULL` and must point to a valid `boardList` with at least one node. If `list` is `NULL` or the list is empty, the function does nothing.
- **Output**: None
- **See Also**: [`boardListUndo`](<../../src/chesslib/boardlist.c.md#boardlistundo>)  (Implementation)


---
### boardListFree<!-- {{#callable_declaration:boardListFree}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/boardlist.h#L35>)

Frees a board list and all its nodes.
- **Description**: Use this function to release all memory associated with a `boardList` and its nodes. Call this function when the list is no longer needed to prevent memory leaks. Ensure that the `list` parameter is not null before calling this function. This function will free each `board` within the nodes and the nodes themselves, followed by the list structure.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to the `boardList` to free. Must not be null. The function will free all nodes and the list itself, so the caller must not use the list after this function is called.
- **Output**: None
- **See Also**: [`boardListFree`](<../../src/chesslib/boardlist.c.md#boardlistfree>)  (Implementation)
