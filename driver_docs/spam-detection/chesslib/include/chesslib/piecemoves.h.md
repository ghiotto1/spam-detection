Defines functions to generate potential move lists for chess pieces, including leapers and riders.

# Purpose
This C header file defines functions related to generating potential moves for chess pieces on a board. It includes functions for both leapers, which move to specific squares based on given offsets, and riders, which continue moving in a direction until they encounter an obstacle. The file provides specific functions to generate move lists for each type of chess piece, such as pawns, knights, bishops, rooks, queens, and kings. Additionally, it includes a specialized function for calculating pawn attack moves. The header file avoids circular dependencies by not being included in `move.h`, and it relies on the `board` and `movelist` structures from the `chesslib` library.

### pmLeaperMoveList<!-- {{#callable_declaration:pmLeaperMoveList}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/piecemoves.h#L19>)

Generates a list of potential moves for a leaper piece on a chessboard.
- **Description**: Use this function to determine all possible moves for a leaper piece from a given position on a chessboard. A leaper can move to specific squares defined by directional offsets. The function requires a valid board, a starting square, a piece type, an array of directional offsets, and the number of directions. It returns a list of potential moves, which may include moves that leave the player in check. Ensure the piece at the starting square matches the specified piece type before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `b`: A pointer to a `board` structure representing the current state of the chessboard. Must not be null.
    - `s`: A `sq` structure representing the starting square of the piece. Must be a valid square on the board.
    - `pt`: A `pieceType` indicating the type of piece for which to generate moves. The piece at the starting square must match this type.
    - `dirs`: A 2D array of integers representing directional offsets for the leaper's movement. Each pair of integers defines a possible move direction.
    - `numDirs`: A `size_t` value indicating the number of directional offsets provided in `dirs`. Must be greater than zero.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to a `moveList` containing potential moves for the leaper piece. The list may be empty if no valid moves are found.
- **See Also**: [`pmLeaperMoveList`](<../../src/chesslib/piecemoves.c.md#pmleapermovelist>)  (Implementation)

### pmRiderMoveList<!-- {{#callable_declaration:pmRiderMoveList}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/piecemoves.h#L21>)

Generates potential moves for a rider piece on a chessboard.
- **Description**: Use this function to get a list of all potential moves for a rider piece, such as a rook or bishop, from a given position on the board. The function considers the piece's ability to move in specified directions until it encounters another piece or the edge of the board. It is important to ensure that the piece at the starting square matches the specified piece type. The function does not check if the moves leave the player in check.
- **Inputs**:
    - `b`: A pointer to the `board` structure representing the current state of the chessboard. Must not be null.
    - `s`: The starting square (`sq`) from which to calculate potential moves. Must be a valid square on the board.
    - `pt`: The type of the piece (`pieceType`) for which to generate moves. Must match the type of the piece at the starting square.
    - `dirs`: An array of direction offsets (`int8_t dirs[][2]`) that define the possible movement directions for the piece. Each direction is a pair of integers representing file and rank offsets.
    - `numDirs`: The number of direction pairs in the `dirs` array (`size_t`). Must be greater than zero.
- **Output**: A pointer to a `moveList` containing potential moves for the rider piece. The list may be empty if no valid moves are found.
- **See Also**: [`pmRiderMoveList`](<../../src/chesslib/piecemoves.c.md#pmridermovelist>)  (Implementation)

[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/piecemoves.h#L24>)

Generates a list of potential moves for a pawn on a chessboard.
- **Description**: Use this function to get all possible moves for a pawn located at a specific square on a given chessboard. It considers standard pawn movement rules, including forward moves, double moves from the initial position, and captures, including en passant. The function does not validate if the moves leave the player in check, so additional validation is necessary for complete move legality. Ensure the board and square are correctly initialized before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `b`: A pointer to a `board` structure representing the current state of the chessboard. Must not be null. The function reads from this board to determine the pawn's possible moves.
    - `s`: A `sq` structure representing the square where the pawn is located. Must be a valid square on the board. If the square does not contain a pawn, the function returns an empty move list.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to a `moveList` structure containing potential moves for the pawn. The list may be empty if no valid moves are available.
