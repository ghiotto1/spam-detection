Defines functions to generate potential move lists for chess pieces, including leapers and riders.

# Purpose
This C header file defines functions related to generating potential moves for chess pieces on a board. It includes functions for both leapers and riders, which are types of chess pieces that move in specific patterns. The [`pmLeaperMoveList`](<#pmleapermovelist>) function generates a list of potential moves for leaper pieces, such as knights, based on given directional offsets. The [`pmRiderMoveList`](<#pmridermovelist>) function does the same for rider pieces, like bishops and rooks, which can move multiple squares in a direction until they encounter an obstacle. Additionally, the file provides specific functions to generate potential moves for each type of chess piece, including pawns, knights, bishops, rooks, queens, and kings. The pawn has a special function, [`pmGetPawnAttacks`](<#pmgetpawnattacks>), to handle its unique attack pattern. These functions return a `moveList` of potential moves, which may include moves that leave the player in check.

### pmLeaperMoveList<!-- {{#callable_declaration:pmLeaperMoveList}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/piecemoves.h#L19>)

Generates a list of potential moves for a leaper piece on a chessboard.
- **Description**: Use this function to determine all possible moves for a leaper piece from a given position on a chessboard. A leaper can move to specific squares defined by directional offsets. The function requires a valid board state, the current position of the piece, the type of the piece, and an array of directional offsets. It returns a list of potential moves, which may include moves that leave the player in check. Ensure the piece at the given position matches the specified type before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `b`: A pointer to a `board` structure representing the current state of the chessboard. Must not be null.
    - `s`: A `sq` structure representing the current position of the piece on the board. Must be a valid square on the board.
    - `pt`: A `pieceType` indicating the type of the piece for which moves are being generated. Must match the type of the piece at the given position.
    - `dirs`: A 2D array of integers representing directional offsets for the leaper's movement. Each element is a tuple of two integers indicating file and rank offsets.
    - `numDirs`: A `size_t` value indicating the number of directional offsets provided in `dirs`. Must be greater than zero.
- **Output**: A pointer to a `moveList` containing potential moves for the leaper piece. The list may be empty if no valid moves are found.
- **See Also**: [`pmLeaperMoveList`](<../../src/chesslib/piecemoves.c.md#pmleapermovelist>)  (Implementation)

### pmRiderMoveList<!-- {{#callable_declaration:pmRiderMoveList}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/piecemoves.h#L21>)

Generates a list of potential moves for a rider piece on a chessboard.
- **Description**: Use this function to obtain a list of all potential moves for a rider piece, such as a rook, bishop, or queen, from a given position on a chessboard. The function considers the piece's type and color, and it uses the specified directional offsets to determine valid moves. It stops generating moves in a direction when it encounters another piece or the edge of the board. The function does not check if the moves leave the player in check, so additional validation may be necessary.
- **Inputs**:
    - `b`: A pointer to a `board` structure representing the current state of the chessboard. Must not be null.
    - `s`: A `sq` structure representing the starting square of the piece. Must be a valid square on the board.
    - `pt`: A `pieceType` value representing the type of the piece for which to generate moves. Must match the type of the piece at the starting square.
    - `dirs`: A 2D array of integers representing the directional offsets for the piece's movement. Each element is a tuple of two integers indicating file and rank offsets. Must not be null.
    - `numDirs`: A `size_t` value indicating the number of directional offsets provided in `dirs`. Must be greater than zero.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to a `moveList` containing potential moves for the rider piece. The list may be empty if no valid moves are found.
- **See Also**: [`pmRiderMoveList`](<../../src/chesslib/piecemoves.c.md#pmridermovelist>)  (Implementation)

### pmGetPawnMoves<!-- {{#callable_declaration:pmGetPawnMoves}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/piecemoves.h#L24>)

Generates a list of potential moves for a pawn on a chessboard.
- **Description**: Use this function to obtain all possible moves for a pawn located at a specific square on a given chessboard. It considers standard pawn movement rules, including forward moves, double moves from the initial position, and captures, including en passant. The function does not validate if the moves leave the player in check, so additional validation is necessary for complete move legality. Ensure the board and square are correctly initialized before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `b`: A pointer to a `board` structure representing the current state of the chessboard. Must not be null. The function reads from this board to determine the pawn's possible moves.
    - `s`: A `sq` structure representing the square where the pawn is located. Must be a valid square on the board. If the square does not contain a pawn, the function returns an empty move list.
- **Output**: A pointer to a `moveList` structure containing potential moves for the pawn. The list may be empty if no valid moves are available.
- **See Also**: [`pmGetPawnMoves`](<../../src/chesslib/piecemoves.c.md#pmgetpawnmoves>)  (Implementation)
