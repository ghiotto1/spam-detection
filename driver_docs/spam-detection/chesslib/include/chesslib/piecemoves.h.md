Defines functions to generate potential move lists for chess pieces, including leapers and riders.

# Purpose
This C header file defines functions related to generating potential moves for chess pieces on a board. It includes functions for both leapers and riders, which are types of chess pieces that move in specific patterns. The [`pmLeaperMoveList`](<#pmleapermovelist>) function generates a list of potential moves for leaper pieces, such as knights, based on given directional offsets. The [`pmRiderMoveList`](<#pmridermovelist>) function extends this concept to riders, which can move repeatedly in a direction until they encounter an obstacle. Additionally, the file provides specific functions to generate potential moves for each type of chess piece, including pawns, knights, bishops, rooks, queens, and kings, as well as a special function for pawn attacks. These functions return a `moveList` of potential moves, which may include moves that leave the player in check. The file includes necessary headers for board and move list structures, ensuring the functions can operate on the chess board state.

### pmLeaperMoveList<!-- {{#callable_declaration:pmLeaperMoveList}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/piecemoves.h#L19>)

Generates a list of potential moves for a leaper piece on a chessboard.
- **Description**: Use this function to get a list of potential moves for a leaper piece from a specific square on a chessboard. A leaper can move to a square defined by a set of directional offsets. The function checks if the piece at the given square matches the specified piece type before calculating moves. It considers only valid board positions and potential moves that do not leave the current player in check. The function returns a move list, which may be empty if no valid moves are found or if the piece type does not match.
- **Inputs**:
    - `b`: A pointer to the `board` structure representing the current state of the chessboard. Must not be null.
    - `s`: The `sq` structure representing the current position of the piece on the board. Must be a valid square on the board.
    - `pt`: The `pieceType` enumeration value representing the type of the piece to move. The function checks if the piece at the given square matches this type.
    - `dirs`: A two-dimensional array of integers representing the directional offsets for the leaper's potential moves. Each pair of integers defines a move direction.
    - `numDirs`: The number of directional pairs in the `dirs` array. Must be greater than zero and correspond to the actual number of directions provided.
- **Output**: A pointer to a `moveList` structure containing potential moves for the leaper piece. The list may be empty if no valid moves are found.
- **See Also**: [`pmLeaperMoveList`](<../../src/chesslib/piecemoves.c.md#pmleapermovelist>)  (Implementation)

[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/piecemoves.h#L21>)

Generates a list of potential moves for a rider piece on a chessboard.
- **Description**: Use this function to get all possible moves for a rider piece, such as a rook, bishop, or queen, from a given position on the board. The function considers the piece's type and its movement directions, continuing in each direction until it encounters another piece or the edge of the board. It returns a list of potential moves, which may include moves that leave the player in check. Ensure the board and position are valid before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `b`: A pointer to the `board` structure representing the current state of the chessboard. Must not be null.
    - `s`: The starting square (`sq`) from which to calculate potential moves. Must be a valid square on the board.
    - `pt`: The type of the piece (`pieceType`) for which to generate moves. Must match the type of the piece at the starting square.
    - `dirs`: A 2D array of integers representing the movement directions for the piece. Each direction is a pair of offsets (file, rank). Must not be null.
    - `numDirs`: The number of directions in the `dirs` array. Must be greater than zero and correspond to the actual number of directions provided.
- **Output**: A pointer to a `moveList` containing potential moves for the rider piece. The list may be empty if no valid moves are found.
