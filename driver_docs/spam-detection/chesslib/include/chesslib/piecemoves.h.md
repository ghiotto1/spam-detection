Defines functions to generate potential move lists for chess pieces, including leapers and riders.

# Purpose
This C header file defines functions related to generating potential moves for chess pieces on a board. It includes functions for both leapers, which move to specific squares based on given offsets, and riders, which continue moving in a direction until they encounter an obstacle. The file provides specific functions to generate move lists for each type of chess piece, such as pawns, knights, bishops, rooks, queens, and kings. Additionally, it includes a specialized function for calculating pawn attack moves. The header file avoids circular dependencies by not being included in `move.h`, and it relies on the `board` and `movelist` structures from the `chesslib` library.

### pmLeaperMoveList<!-- {{#callable_declaration:pmLeaperMoveList}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/piecemoves.h#L19>)

Generates a list of potential moves for a leaper piece on a chessboard.
- **Description**: Use this function to get a list of potential moves for a leaper piece, such as a knight, on a chessboard. The function requires the current board state, the position of the piece, the type of the piece, and an array of directional offsets that define the leaper's movement pattern. It returns a list of moves that the piece can make based on these offsets, considering the boundaries of the board and the presence of other pieces. The function does not check if the moves leave the player in check.
- **Inputs**:
    - `b`: A pointer to the `board` structure representing the current state of the chessboard. Must not be null.
    - `s`: The `sq` structure representing the current position of the piece on the board. Must be a valid square on the board.
    - `pt`: The `pieceType` enumeration value representing the type of the piece to move. Must match the type of the piece at the given square.
    - `dirs`: A two-dimensional array of integers representing the directional offsets for the leaper's movement. Each pair of integers defines a possible move direction.
    - `numDirs`: The number of directional offsets provided in the `dirs` array. Must be greater than zero.
- **Output**: A pointer to a `moveList` structure containing the potential moves for the leaper piece. The list may be empty if no valid moves are found.
- **See Also**: [`pmLeaperMoveList`](<../../src/chesslib/piecemoves.c.md#pmleapermovelist>)  (Implementation)

### pmRiderMoveList<!-- {{#callable_declaration:pmRiderMoveList}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/piecemoves.h#L21>)

Generates potential moves for a rider piece on a chessboard.
- **Description**: Use this function to get a list of potential moves for a rider piece, such as a rook, bishop, or queen, on a given chessboard. The function calculates moves based on the piece's ability to move in specified directions until it encounters another piece or the edge of the board. It is important to ensure that the piece at the starting square matches the specified piece type before calling this function. The function does not check for moves that would leave the player in check.
- **Inputs**:
    - `b`: A pointer to a `board` structure representing the current state of the chessboard. Must not be null.
    - `s`: A `sq` structure representing the starting square of the piece. Must be a valid square on the board.
    - `pt`: A `pieceType` value representing the type of the piece for which to generate moves. Must match the type of the piece at the starting square.
    - `dirs`: A 2D array of integers representing the directions in which the piece can move. Each direction is a pair of offsets (file, rank). Must not be null.
    - `numDirs`: A `size_t` value indicating the number of directions provided in the `dirs` array. Must be greater than zero.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to a `moveList` containing potential moves for the specified rider piece. The list may be empty if no valid moves are found.
- **See Also**: [`pmRiderMoveList`](<../../src/chesslib/piecemoves.c.md#pmridermovelist>)  (Implementation)

### pmGetPawnMoves<!-- {{#callable_declaration:pmGetPawnMoves}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/piecemoves.h#L24>)

Generates a list of potential moves for a pawn on a chessboard.
- **Description**: Use this function to obtain all possible moves for a pawn located at a specific square on a given chessboard. It considers standard pawn movement rules, including forward moves and captures, as well as special cases like en passant. The function assumes the piece at the specified square is a pawn and returns an empty list if it is not. The returned list may include moves that leave the player in check, so further validation is necessary.
- **Inputs**:
    - `b`: A pointer to a `board` structure representing the current state of the chessboard. Must not be null. The function reads from this board to determine the pawn's possible moves.
    - `s`: A `sq` structure representing the square on the board where the pawn is located. The function assumes this square contains a pawn and returns an empty list if it does not.
- **Output**: A pointer to a `moveList` structure containing potential moves for the pawn. The list may be empty if no valid moves are found or if the piece at the square is not a pawn.
- **See Also**: [`pmGetPawnMoves`](<../../src/chesslib/piecemoves.c.md#pmgetpawnmoves>)  (Implementation)

Generates potential knight moves from a given board position.
- **Description**: Use this function to obtain a list of all potential moves for a knight located at a specific square on a chess board. This function is useful when you need to evaluate possible knight moves without considering whether these moves leave the player in check. It is important to ensure that the board and square parameters are valid before calling this function to avoid undefined behavior.
- **Inputs**:
    - `b`: A pointer to a `board` structure representing the current state of the chess game. Must not be null, and must point to a valid board configuration.
    - `s`: A `sq` value representing the square on the board where the knight is currently located. Must be a valid square within the board's boundaries.
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to a `moveList` structure containing potential moves for the knight. The caller is responsible for managing the memory of the returned move list.

- **Description**: Use this function to obtain a list of all potential moves for a queen piece from a specified position on the chess board. This function is useful when you need to evaluate possible queen moves without considering whether these moves leave the player in check. It is important to note that the returned move list may include moves that are not legal in the current game state, as it does not account for checks.

Generates potential king moves from a given board position.
- **Description**: Use this function to obtain a list of all potential moves for a king piece from a specified position on the chess board. This function is useful when you need to evaluate possible king moves without considering whether these moves would leave the king in check. It is important to note that the returned move list may include moves that are not legal in the context of the current game state, as it does not account for check conditions.

### pmGetPawnAttacks<!-- {{#callable_declaration:pmGetPawnAttacks}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/piecemoves.h#L32>)

Generates a list of potential attack moves for a pawn on a chessboard.
- **Description**: Use this function to get a list of potential attack moves for a pawn located at a specific square on a chessboard. It is important to ensure that the square contains a pawn before calling this function, as it will return an empty list if the piece is not a pawn. The function considers the pawn's color to determine the direction of attack and checks the adjacent diagonal squares for valid attack moves. The returned list may include moves that leave the player in check, so further validation may be necessary.
- **Inputs**:
    - `b`: A pointer to a `board` structure representing the current state of the chessboard. Must not be null. The function reads from this board to determine valid attack moves.
    - `s`: A `sq` structure representing the square on the board where the pawn is located. The square must be within the valid range of the board, and it is expected to contain a pawn piece.
- **Output**: A pointer to a `moveList` structure containing potential attack moves for the pawn. The list is empty if the square does not contain a pawn.
- **See Also**: [`pmGetPawnAttacks`](<../../src/chesslib/piecemoves.c.md#pmgetpawnattacks>)  (Implementation)
