Defines chess piece types, colors, and related functions.

# Purpose
This code defines enumerations and functions for managing chess pieces in a C program. The `pieceType` enumeration lists the types of chess pieces, such as `ptPawn` and `ptKing`. The `piece` enumeration includes specific pieces for both white and black, like `pWPawn` and `pBKing`. The `pieceColor` enumeration defines the color of the pieces, either `pcWhite` or `pcBlack`. The functions [`pieceGetType`](<#piecegettype>) and [`pieceGetColor`](<#piecegetcolor>) return the type and color of a given piece, respectively. The functions [`pieceTypeGetLetter`](<#piecetypegetletter>) and [`pieceGetLetter`](<#piecegetletter>) return a character representation of a piece type or a specific piece. The [`pieceMake`](<#piecemake>) function creates a piece from a given type and color.

# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### pieceGetType<!-- {{#callable_declaration:pieceGetType}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/piece.h#L43>)

Converts a piece to its corresponding piece type.
- **Description**: Use this function to determine the type of a chess piece, such as pawn, knight, or bishop, from a given piece enumeration. This function is useful when you need to identify the type of a piece without considering its color. It is important to pass a valid `piece` enumeration value to ensure correct behavior.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: A `piece` enumeration value representing a chess piece. Valid values range from `pEmpty` to `pBKing`. Passing an invalid value may result in undefined behavior.
- **Output**: Returns the `pieceType` corresponding to the input `piece`, such as `ptPawn` for `pWPawn` or `pBPawn`.
- **See Also**: [`pieceGetType`](<../../src/chesslib/piece.c.md#piecegettype>)  (Implementation)


---
### pieceGetColor<!-- {{#callable_declaration:pieceGetColor}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/piece.h#L44>)

Determines the color of a chess piece.
- **Description**: Use this function to find the color of a given chess piece. It returns the color as `pcWhite` for white pieces, `pcBlack` for black pieces, and `pcNoColor` for pieces that do not have a color, such as `pEmpty`. This function is useful when you need to differentiate between white and black pieces in a chess game. Ensure that the input is a valid `piece` enumeration value.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: A `piece` enumeration value representing a chess piece. Valid values range from `pWPawn` to `pBKing` for colored pieces, and `pEmpty` for no color. The function returns `pcNoColor` for invalid or uncolored pieces.
- **Output**: Returns a `pieceColor` enumeration value: `pcWhite`, `pcBlack`, or `pcNoColor`.
- **See Also**: [`pieceGetColor`](<../../src/chesslib/piece.c.md#piecegetcolor>)  (Implementation)


---
### pieceTypeGetLetter<!-- {{#callable_declaration:pieceTypeGetLetter}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/piece.h#L45>)

Returns the character representation of a chess piece type.
- **Description**: Use this function to get the standard single-letter representation of a chess piece type. This function is useful when you need to display or log the type of a chess piece in a human-readable format. The function expects a valid `pieceType` enumeration value as input. If the input is `ptEmpty`, it returns a space character. For any other invalid input, it returns a null character ('\0').
- **Inputs**:
    - `pe`: A `pieceType` enumeration value representing the type of a chess piece. Valid values are `ptPawn`, `ptKnight`, `ptBishop`, `ptRook`, `ptQueen`, `ptKing`, and `ptEmpty`. The function returns a null character ('\0') for invalid values.
- **Output**: A character representing the chess piece type: 'P' for pawn, 'N' for knight, 'B' for bishop, 'R' for rook, 'Q' for queen, 'K' for king, a space for `ptEmpty`, or '\0' for invalid input.
- **See Also**: [`pieceTypeGetLetter`](<../../src/chesslib/piece.c.md#piecetypegetletter>)  (Implementation)


---
### pieceGetLetter<!-- {{#callable_declaration:pieceGetLetter}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/piece.h#L46>)

Returns the character representation of a chess piece.
- **Description**: Use this function to get the character that represents a chess piece, based on its type and color. The function returns an uppercase letter for white pieces and a lowercase letter for black pieces. It is important to ensure that the input is a valid `piece` enumeration value to avoid undefined behavior.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: A `piece` enumeration value representing a chess piece. Must be a valid `piece` value; otherwise, the behavior is undefined.
- **Output**: A character representing the chess piece, with uppercase for white and lowercase for black.
- **See Also**: [`pieceGetLetter`](<../../src/chesslib/piece.c.md#piecegetletter>)  (Implementation)


---
### pieceMake<!-- {{#callable_declaration:pieceMake}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/piece.h#L47>)

Creates a chess piece with a specified type and color.
- **Description**: Use this function to create a chess piece by specifying its type and color. The function returns a piece of the specified type and color if the inputs are valid. If the color is not `pcWhite` or `pcBlack`, or if the type is not recognized, the function returns `pEmpty`. This function is useful for initializing pieces in a chess game setup.
- **Inputs**:
    - `type`: Specifies the type of the chess piece. Must be one of the values from the `pieceType` enumeration, such as `ptKing`, `ptQueen`, etc. If the type is not recognized, the function returns `pEmpty`.
    - `color`: Specifies the color of the chess piece. Must be either `pcWhite` or `pcBlack`. If the color is not one of these values, the function returns `pEmpty`.
- **Output**: Returns a `piece` of the specified type and color, or `pEmpty` if the inputs are invalid.
- **See Also**: [`pieceMake`](<../../src/chesslib/piece.c.md#piecemake>)  (Implementation)
