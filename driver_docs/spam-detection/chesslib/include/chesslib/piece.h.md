Defines chess piece types, colors, and related functions for type and color retrieval.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines enumerations and functions for handling chess pieces. The `pieceType` enumeration defines the types of chess pieces, such as `ptPawn` and `ptKing`. The `piece` enumeration includes specific pieces for both white and black, such as `pWPawn` and `pBKing`. The `pieceColor` enumeration specifies the color of the pieces, either `pcWhite` or `pcBlack`. The file also declares several functions: [`pieceGetType`](<#piecegettype>) and [`pieceGetColor`](<#piecegetcolor>) to retrieve the type and color of a piece, [`pieceTypeGetLetter`](<#piecetypegetletter>) and [`pieceGetLetter`](<#piecegetletter>) to get the character representation of a piece type or piece, and [`pieceMake`](<#piecemake>) to create a piece from a given type and color.

# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### pieceGetType<!-- {{#callable_declaration:pieceGetType}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/piece.h#L43>)

Converts a `piece` to its corresponding `pieceType`.
- **Description**: Use this function to determine the type of a chess piece from its `piece` enumeration value. This function is useful when you need to identify the type of a piece without regard to its color. It is important to ensure that the input is a valid `piece` enumeration value to avoid undefined behavior.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: A `piece` enumeration value representing a chess piece. Valid values are from the `piece` enum, including both white and black pieces. The function does not handle invalid `piece` values.
- **Output**: Returns the `pieceType` corresponding to the input `piece`, which represents the type of the chess piece without color information.
- **See Also**: [`pieceGetType`](<../../src/chesslib/piece.c.md#piecegettype>)  (Implementation)


---
### pieceGetColor<!-- {{#callable_declaration:pieceGetColor}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/piece.h#L44>)

Determines the color of a chess piece.
- **Description**: Use this function to find the color of a given chess piece. It returns the color as either white, black, or no color if the piece is not recognized. This function is useful when you need to differentiate between pieces of different colors in a chess game. Ensure that the input is a valid piece enumeration value to avoid unexpected results.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: A chess piece represented by the `piece` enumeration. Valid values range from `pWPawn` to `pBKing`. If the value is outside this range, the function returns `pcNoColor`.
- **Output**: Returns a `pieceColor` enumeration value: `pcWhite` for white pieces, `pcBlack` for black pieces, or `pcNoColor` if the piece is not recognized.
- **See Also**: [`pieceGetColor`](<../../src/chesslib/piece.c.md#piecegetcolor>)  (Implementation)


---
### pieceTypeGetLetter<!-- {{#callable_declaration:pieceTypeGetLetter}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/piece.h#L45>)

Returns the character representation of a chess piece type.
- **Description**: Use this function to get the character that represents a specific chess piece type. This is useful for displaying or logging the piece type in a human-readable format. The function expects a valid `pieceType` enumeration value as input. If the input is not a valid `pieceType`, the function returns a null character ('\0').
- **Inputs**:
    - `pe`: A `pieceType` enumeration value representing the type of chess piece. Valid values are `ptEmpty`, `ptPawn`, `ptKnight`, `ptBishop`, `ptRook`, `ptQueen`, and `ptKing`. If the value is not valid, the function returns a null character ('\0').
- **Output**: Returns a character representing the chess piece type: 'P' for pawn, 'N' for knight, 'B' for bishop, 'R' for rook, 'Q' for queen, 'K' for king, and ' ' for empty. Returns '\0' for invalid input.
- **See Also**: [`pieceTypeGetLetter`](<../../src/chesslib/piece.c.md#piecetypegetletter>)  (Implementation)


---
### pieceGetLetter<!-- {{#callable_declaration:pieceGetLetter}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/piece.h#L46>)

Returns the character representation of a chess piece.
- **Description**: Use this function to get the character that represents a given chess piece. The function returns an uppercase letter for white pieces and a lowercase letter for black pieces. It is important to ensure that the input piece is valid and corresponds to a defined piece type and color.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: A `piece` enumeration value representing a chess piece. The value must correspond to a valid piece type and color. Invalid values may lead to undefined behavior.
- **Output**: A character representing the chess piece, with case indicating the piece's color (uppercase for white, lowercase for black).
- **See Also**: [`pieceGetLetter`](<../../src/chesslib/piece.c.md#piecegetletter>)  (Implementation)


---
### pieceMake<!-- {{#callable_declaration:pieceMake}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/piece.h#L47>)

Creates a chess piece with a specified type and color.
- **Description**: Use this function to create a chess piece by specifying its type and color. The function returns a piece of the specified type and color if the inputs are valid. If the color is not `pcWhite` or `pcBlack`, or if the type is not a valid chess piece type, the function returns `pEmpty`. This function is useful for initializing or modifying chess pieces in a chess game application.
- **Inputs**:
    - `type`: Specifies the type of the chess piece. Must be one of the valid `pieceType` values such as `ptKing`, `ptQueen`, etc. If an invalid type is provided, the function returns `pEmpty`.
    - `color`: Specifies the color of the chess piece. Must be `pcWhite` or `pcBlack`. If an invalid color is provided, the function returns `pEmpty`.
- **Output**: Returns a `piece` of the specified type and color, or `pEmpty` if the inputs are invalid.
- **See Also**: [`pieceMake`](<../../src/chesslib/piece.c.md#piecemake>)  (Implementation)
