Defines chess piece types, colors, and related functions.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines enumerations and functions for representing and manipulating chess pieces. The `pieceType` enumeration defines the types of chess pieces, such as `ptPawn` and `ptKing`. The `piece` enumeration includes specific pieces with color, like `pWPawn` for a white pawn and `pBKing` for a black king. The `pieceColor` enumeration specifies the color of the pieces, either `pcWhite` or `pcBlack`. The file also declares several functions: [`pieceGetType`](<#piecegettype>) and [`pieceGetColor`](<#piecegetcolor>) to retrieve the type and color of a piece, [`pieceTypeGetLetter`](<#piecetypegetletter>) and [`pieceGetLetter`](<#piecegetletter>) to get the character representation of a piece type or piece, and [`pieceMake`](<#piecemake>) to create a piece from a given type and color.

# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### pieceGetType<!-- {{#callable_declaration:pieceGetType}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/piece.h#L43>)

Determines the type of a chess piece.
- **Description**: Use this function to get the type of a chess piece from a given `piece` enumeration value. It converts the `piece` value to a `pieceType` value, which represents the type of the piece without regard to its color. This function is useful when you need to identify the type of a piece, such as pawn, knight, bishop, etc., from a combined piece and color enumeration. Ensure that the input is a valid `piece` enumeration value to avoid undefined behavior.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: A `piece` enumeration value representing a chess piece. Valid values are from the `piece` enum, including both white and black pieces. The function does not handle invalid `piece` values and expects a valid input.
- **Output**: Returns a `pieceType` enumeration value corresponding to the type of the input `piece`, such as `ptPawn`, `ptKnight`, etc.
- **See Also**: [`pieceGetType`](<../../src/chesslib/piece.c.md#piecegettype>)  (Implementation)


---
### pieceGetColor<!-- {{#callable_declaration:pieceGetColor}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/piece.h#L44>)

Determines the color of a chess piece.
- **Description**: Use this function to get the color of a given chess piece. It returns the color as `pcWhite` for white pieces, `pcBlack` for black pieces, and `pcNoColor` for pieces that do not have a color, such as `pEmpty`. This function is useful when you need to differentiate between white and black pieces or handle empty squares in a chess game.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: A `piece` value representing a chess piece. Valid values range from `pEmpty` to `pBKing`. The function handles all valid `piece` values and returns `pcNoColor` for `pEmpty`.
- **Output**: Returns a `pieceColor` value indicating the color of the piece: `pcWhite`, `pcBlack`, or `pcNoColor`.
- **See Also**: [`pieceGetColor`](<../../src/chesslib/piece.c.md#piecegetcolor>)  (Implementation)


---
### pieceTypeGetLetter<!-- {{#callable_declaration:pieceTypeGetLetter}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/piece.h#L45>)

Returns the character representation of a chess piece type.
- **Description**: Use this function to get the character that represents a specific chess piece type. This is useful for displaying or logging chess pieces in a human-readable format. The function expects a valid `pieceType` enumeration value as input. If the input is `ptEmpty`, the function returns a space character. For any other invalid input, the function returns a null character ('\0').
- **Inputs**:
    - `pe`: A `pieceType` enumeration value representing the type of chess piece. Valid values are `ptEmpty`, `ptPawn`, `ptKnight`, `ptBishop`, `ptRook`, `ptQueen`, and `ptKing`. The function returns a space character for `ptEmpty` and a null character for invalid values.
- **Output**: Returns a character representing the chess piece type: 'P' for pawn, 'N' for knight, 'B' for bishop, 'R' for rook, 'Q' for queen, 'K' for king, a space for `ptEmpty`, and '\0' for invalid inputs.
- **See Also**: [`pieceTypeGetLetter`](<../../src/chesslib/piece.c.md#piecetypegetletter>)  (Implementation)


---
### pieceGetLetter<!-- {{#callable_declaration:pieceGetLetter}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/piece.h#L46>)

Returns the character representation of a chess piece.
- **Description**: Use this function to get the character that represents a chess piece, based on its type and color. The function returns an uppercase letter for white pieces and a lowercase letter for black pieces. It is important to ensure that the input piece is valid and corresponds to a defined piece type and color.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: A `piece` value representing a chess piece. It must be a valid piece enumeration value, such as `pWPawn` or `pBKing`. Invalid values can lead to undefined behavior.
- **Output**: A character representing the piece, with uppercase for white pieces and lowercase for black pieces.
- **See Also**: [`pieceGetLetter`](<../../src/chesslib/piece.c.md#piecegetletter>)  (Implementation)


---
### pieceMake<!-- {{#callable_declaration:pieceMake}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/piece.h#L47>)

Creates a chess piece with a specified type and color.
- **Description**: Use this function to create a chess piece by specifying its type and color. The function returns a piece of the specified type and color if the color is valid. If the color is not valid, or if the type is not recognized, the function returns `pEmpty`. This function is useful for initializing or modifying chess pieces in a game. Ensure that the color is either `pcWhite` or `pcBlack` before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `type`: Specifies the type of the chess piece. Must be one of the values from the `pieceType` enumeration, such as `ptKing`, `ptQueen`, etc. If the type is not recognized, the function returns `pEmpty`.
    - `color`: Specifies the color of the chess piece. Must be either `pcWhite` or `pcBlack`. If the color is not valid, the function returns `pEmpty`.
- **Output**: Returns a `piece` of the specified type and color, or `pEmpty` if the inputs are invalid.
- **See Also**: [`pieceMake`](<../../src/chesslib/piece.c.md#piecemake>)  (Implementation)
