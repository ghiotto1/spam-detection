Defines chess piece types, colors, and related functions for type and color retrieval.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines enumerations and functions for representing and manipulating chess pieces. The `pieceType` enumeration defines the types of chess pieces, such as `ptPawn` and `ptKing`. The `piece` enumeration includes specific pieces with their colors, like `pWPawn` for a white pawn and `pBKing` for a black king. The `pieceColor` enumeration specifies the color of the pieces, either `pcWhite` or `pcBlack`. The file also declares several functions: [`pieceGetType`](<#piecegettype>) and [`pieceGetColor`](<#piecegetcolor>) to retrieve the type and color of a piece, [`pieceTypeGetLetter`](<#piecetypegetletter>) and [`pieceGetLetter`](<#piecegetletter>) to get the character representation of a piece type or piece, and [`pieceMake`](<#piecemake>) to create a piece from a given type and color.

# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### pieceGetType<!-- {{#callable_declaration:pieceGetType}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/piece.h#L43>)

Gets the type of a chess piece.
- **Description**: Use this function to determine the type of a given chess piece, such as pawn, knight, bishop, etc. It is useful when you need to identify the role of a piece in a chess game. The function expects a valid `piece` enumeration value as input and returns the corresponding `pieceType`. Ensure that the input is within the defined `piece` enumeration values to avoid unexpected behavior.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: A `piece` enumeration value representing a chess piece. Must be a valid value from the `piece` enum. If the value is not within the defined range, the behavior is undefined.
- **Output**: Returns a `pieceType` enumeration value corresponding to the input `piece`, indicating the type of the chess piece.
- **See Also**: [`pieceGetType`](<../../src/chesslib/piece.c.md#piecegettype>)  (Implementation)


---
### pieceGetColor<!-- {{#callable_declaration:pieceGetColor}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/piece.h#L44>)

Determines the color of a chess piece.
- **Description**: Use this function to find the color of a given chess piece. It returns the color as `pcWhite` for white pieces, `pcBlack` for black pieces, and `pcNoColor` for an empty piece. This function is useful when you need to differentiate between white and black pieces or check if a piece is empty. Ensure that the input is a valid `piece` enumeration value.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: A `piece` enumeration value representing a chess piece. Valid values range from `pEmpty` to `pBKing`. The function returns `pcNoColor` if the piece is `pEmpty`.
- **Output**: Returns a `pieceColor` enumeration value: `pcWhite`, `pcBlack`, or `pcNoColor`.
- **See Also**: [`pieceGetColor`](<../../src/chesslib/piece.c.md#piecegetcolor>)  (Implementation)


---
### pieceTypeGetLetter<!-- {{#callable_declaration:pieceTypeGetLetter}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/piece.h#L45>)

Returns the character representation of a chess piece type.
- **Description**: Use this function to get the character that represents a specific chess piece type. This is useful for displaying or logging chess pieces in a human-readable format. The function expects a valid `pieceType` enumeration value as input. If the input is `ptEmpty`, the function returns a space character. For any other invalid input, the function returns a null character ('\0').
- **Inputs**:
    - `pe`: A `pieceType` enumeration value representing the type of chess piece. Valid values are `ptPawn`, `ptKnight`, `ptBishop`, `ptRook`, `ptQueen`, `ptKing`, and `ptEmpty`. The function returns a null character ('\0') for invalid values.
- **Output**: Returns a character corresponding to the chess piece type: 'P' for pawn, 'N' for knight, 'B' for bishop, 'R' for rook, 'Q' for queen, 'K' for king, a space for `ptEmpty`, and '\0' for invalid input.
- **See Also**: [`pieceTypeGetLetter`](<../../src/chesslib/piece.c.md#piecetypegetletter>)  (Implementation)


---
### pieceGetLetter<!-- {{#callable_declaration:pieceGetLetter}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/piece.h#L46>)

Returns the character representation of a chess piece.
- **Description**: Use this function to get the character that represents a given chess piece. The character returned corresponds to the type of the piece, and it is in uppercase for white pieces and lowercase for black pieces. This function is useful for displaying or logging the state of a chessboard. Ensure that the input piece is valid as per the defined `piece` enumeration.
- **Inputs**:
    - `p`: A chess piece of type `piece`. It must be a valid value from the `piece` enumeration. The function does not handle invalid values and expects the caller to provide a valid piece.
- **Output**: Returns a character that represents the type and color of the chess piece. The character is uppercase for white pieces and lowercase for black pieces.
- **See Also**: [`pieceGetLetter`](<../../src/chesslib/piece.c.md#piecegetletter>)  (Implementation)


---
### pieceMake<!-- {{#callable_declaration:pieceMake}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/piece.h#L47>)

Creates a chess piece with a specified type and color.
- **Description**: Use this function to create a chess piece by specifying its type and color. The function returns a piece of the specified type and color if the color is valid. If the color is not valid, or if the type is not recognized, the function returns `pEmpty`. This function is useful for initializing or modifying chess pieces in a game. Ensure that the color is either `pcWhite` or `pcBlack` to avoid receiving an empty piece.
- **Inputs**:
    - `type`: Specifies the type of the chess piece. Valid values are `ptPawn`, `ptKnight`, `ptBishop`, `ptRook`, `ptQueen`, and `ptKing`. If the type is not recognized, the function returns `pEmpty`.
    - `color`: Specifies the color of the chess piece. Must be either `pcWhite` or `pcBlack`. If the color is not valid, the function returns `pEmpty`.
- **Output**: Returns a `piece` of the specified type and color, or `pEmpty` if the type or color is invalid.
- **See Also**: [`pieceMake`](<../../src/chesslib/piece.c.md#piecemake>)  (Implementation)
