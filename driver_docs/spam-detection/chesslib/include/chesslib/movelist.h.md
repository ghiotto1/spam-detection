Data structures and functions for managing a list of chess moves.

# Purpose
This code is a C header file that defines data structures and function prototypes for managing a list of chess moves. It includes the definition of two structures: `moveListNode`, which represents a node containing a single move and a pointer to the next node, and `moveList`, which represents the entire list with pointers to the head and tail nodes and a size attribute. The file declares functions for creating and manipulating these structures, such as [`moveListCreate`](<#movelistcreate>) and [`moveListNodeCreate`](<#movelistnodecreate>) for initialization, [`moveListAdd`](<#movelistadd>) for adding moves, [`moveListGet`](<#movelistget>) for retrieving a move by index, and [`moveListUndo`](<#movelistundo>) for removing the last move. Additionally, it provides a function [`moveListGetUciString`](<#movelistgetucistring>) to generate a UCI (Universal Chess Interface) string representation of the move list, and [`moveListFree`](<#movelistfree>) to deallocate the list and its nodes.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `stddef.h`
- `chesslib/move.h`


# Data Structures

---
### moveListNode
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `move`: Contains a `move` data type representing a chess move.
    - `next`: Points to the next `moveListNode` in the list.
- **Description**: Defines a node in a linked list that stores a chess move and a pointer to the next node, enabling traversal through a sequence of moves.


---
### moveList
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `head`: A pointer to the first node in the move list.
    - `tail`: A pointer to the last node in the move list.
    - `size`: The number of nodes in the move list.
- **Description**: Represents a linked list of chess moves, where each node contains a move and a pointer to the next node. The `head` and `tail` pointers allow for efficient addition and removal of moves at the beginning and end of the list, while the `size` member keeps track of the total number of moves in the list.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### moveListCreate<!-- {{#callable_declaration:moveListCreate}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/movelist.h#L26>)

Creates an empty move list.
- **Description**: Use this function to create a new, empty move list for storing chess moves. It initializes the list with no elements and sets the head, tail, and size to their default values. This function allocates memory for the list, so you must call `moveListFree` to release the memory when the list is no longer needed.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to a newly allocated `moveList` structure, or `NULL` if memory allocation fails.
- **See Also**: [`moveListCreate`](<../../src/chesslib/movelist.c.md#movelistcreate>)  (Implementation)


---
### moveListNodeCreate<!-- {{#callable_declaration:moveListNodeCreate}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/movelist.h#L27>)

Creates a new move list node with a specified move.
- **Description**: Use this function to create a new node for a move list, initializing it with a specific move. This function allocates memory for the node, sets the move, and initializes the next pointer to NULL. Ensure to free the allocated memory when the node is no longer needed to prevent memory leaks.
- **Inputs**:
    - `move`: The move to store in the new node. The function does not validate the move, so ensure it is valid before calling.
- **Output**: A pointer to the newly created `moveListNode` containing the specified move, or NULL if memory allocation fails.
- **See Also**: [`moveListNodeCreate`](<../../src/chesslib/movelist.c.md#movelistnodecreate>)  (Implementation)


---
### moveListAdd<!-- {{#callable_declaration:moveListAdd}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/movelist.h#L30>)

Adds a move to the end of a move list.
- **Description**: Use this function to append a move to an existing move list. The function updates the list's head and tail pointers as necessary and increments the list size. Ensure that the `list` parameter is a valid pointer to a `moveList` structure, and that the list has been properly initialized before calling this function. This function does not handle null pointers and assumes that the `move` parameter is valid.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a `moveList` structure. Must not be null. The list must be initialized before use.
    - `move`: A `move` object to add to the list. The function assumes this is a valid move.
- **Output**: None
- **See Also**: [`moveListAdd`](<../../src/chesslib/movelist.c.md#movelistadd>)  (Implementation)


---
### moveListGet<!-- {{#callable_declaration:moveListGet}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/movelist.h#L31>)

Retrieves a move from the move list at a specified index.
- **Description**: Use this function to get a move from a `moveList` at a specific position. The function assumes that the index is within the bounds of the list, so ensure that the index is less than the size of the list to avoid undefined behavior. This function is useful when you need to access a particular move in a sequence of moves stored in a `moveList`. It does not modify the list or the move.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a `moveList` from which to retrieve the move. Must not be null, and the list must be properly initialized.
    - `index`: An unsigned integer representing the position of the move to retrieve. Must be less than the size of the list to avoid undefined behavior.
- **Output**: Returns the `move` at the specified index in the `moveList`.
- **See Also**: [`moveListGet`](<../../src/chesslib/movelist.c.md#movelistget>)  (Implementation)


---
### moveListUndo<!-- {{#callable_declaration:moveListUndo}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/movelist.h#L32>)

Removes the last move from the move list.
- **Description**: Use this function to remove the most recent move from a `moveList`. It decreases the size of the list by one and updates the list's tail pointer. If the list is empty or the head is null, the function does nothing. This function must be called with a valid `moveList` pointer, and it assumes that the list has been properly initialized.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a `moveList` structure. Must not be null. The function does nothing if the list is empty or if the head of the list is null. The caller retains ownership of the list.
- **Output**: None
- **See Also**: [`moveListUndo`](<../../src/chesslib/movelist.c.md#movelistundo>)  (Implementation)


---
### moveListGetUciString<!-- {{#callable_declaration:moveListGetUciString}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/movelist.h#L35>)

Creates a UCI string from the given move list.
- **Description**: Use this function to convert a list of chess moves into a UCI (Universal Chess Interface) formatted string. This function is useful when you need to represent a sequence of moves in a standardized format. The function allocates memory for the resulting string, which the caller must free after use. If the move list is empty, the function returns an empty string. If the list contains one move, the function returns the UCI string for that move. For multiple moves, the function concatenates the UCI strings of each move, separated by spaces.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a `moveList` structure that contains the moves to convert. Must not be null. The function does not modify the list or its contents.
- **Output**: A dynamically allocated string containing the UCI representation of the moves in the list. The caller is responsible for freeing this string.
- **See Also**: [`moveListGetUciString`](<../../src/chesslib/movelist.c.md#movelistgetucistring>)  (Implementation)


---
### moveListFree<!-- {{#callable_declaration:moveListFree}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/movelist.h#L38>)

Frees a move list and all its nodes.
- **Description**: Use this function to release the memory allocated for a `moveList` and all its associated nodes. Call this function when the move list is no longer needed to prevent memory leaks. Ensure that the `list` parameter is not null before calling this function, as passing a null pointer can lead to undefined behavior.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a `moveList` structure. Must not be null. The function will free the memory for the list and all its nodes.
- **Output**: None
- **See Also**: [`moveListFree`](<../../src/chesslib/movelist.c.md#movelistfree>)  (Implementation)
