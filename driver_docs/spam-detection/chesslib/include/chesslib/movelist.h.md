Data structures and functions for managing a list of chess moves.

# Purpose
The code defines a C header file for managing a linked list of chess moves. It includes the definition of two structures: `moveListNode`, which represents a node containing a single chess move and a pointer to the next node, and `moveList`, which represents the linked list with pointers to the head and tail nodes and a size attribute. The file declares functions for creating and managing these structures, including [`moveListCreate`](<#movelistcreate>) and [`moveListNodeCreate`](<#movelistnodecreate>) for initializing the list and nodes, [`moveListAdd`](<#movelistadd>) for adding a move to the list, [`moveListGet`](<#movelistget>) for retrieving a move by index, and [`moveListUndo`](<#movelistundo>) for removing the last move. Additionally, [`moveListGetUciString`](<#movelistgetucistring>) converts the list of moves into a UCI (Universal Chess Interface) string, and [`moveListFree`](<#movelistfree>) deallocates the list and its nodes.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `stddef.h`
- `chesslib/move.h`


# Data Structures

---
### moveListNode
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - ``move``: A `move` object that represents a single move in a chess game.
    - ``next``: A pointer to the next `moveListNode` in the linked list.
- **Description**: Defines a node in a linked list that stores a chess move and a pointer to the next node, allowing for sequential storage and traversal of moves.


---
### moveList
- **Type**: ``struct``
- **Members**:
    - `head`: Points to the first node in the move list.
    - `tail`: Points to the last node in the move list.
    - `size`: Stores the number of nodes in the move list.
- **Description**: Represents a linked list of moves in a chess game, with pointers to the first and last nodes and a size to track the number of moves.


# Function Declarations (Public API)

---
### moveListCreate<!-- {{#callable_declaration:moveListCreate}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/movelist.h#L26>)

Creates an empty move list.
- **Description**: Use this function to create a new, empty move list for storing chess moves. This function allocates memory for the move list structure and initializes its internal pointers and size to represent an empty list. Ensure to free the allocated memory using `moveListFree` when the list is no longer needed to prevent memory leaks.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Output**: Returns a pointer to a newly allocated `moveList` structure initialized to an empty state.
- **See Also**: [`moveListCreate`](<../../src/chesslib/movelist.c.md#movelistcreate>)  (Implementation)


---
### moveListNodeCreate<!-- {{#callable_declaration:moveListNodeCreate}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/movelist.h#L27>)

Creates a new move list node with a specified move.
- **Description**: Use this function to create a new node for a move list, initializing it with a specific move. This function allocates memory for the node, sets the move, and initializes the next pointer to NULL. Ensure that the move is valid before calling this function. The caller is responsible for managing the memory of the created node, including freeing it when it is no longer needed.
- **Inputs**:
    - `move`: The move to store in the new node. Must be a valid move as defined in the `move` type. The function does not validate the move, so ensure it is correct before passing it.
- **Output**: A pointer to the newly created `moveListNode` containing the specified move, or NULL if memory allocation fails.
- **See Also**: [`moveListNodeCreate`](<../../src/chesslib/movelist.c.md#movelistnodecreate>)  (Implementation)


---
### moveListAdd<!-- {{#callable_declaration:moveListAdd}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/movelist.h#L30>)

Adds a move to the end of the move list.
- **Description**: Use this function to append a new move to an existing move list. The function updates the list's tail to point to the new node and increments the list size. If the list is empty, the new node becomes both the head and the tail. Ensure the list is initialized before calling this function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a `moveList` structure where the move will be added. Must not be null and must point to a valid, initialized `moveList`.
    - `move`: A `move` structure representing the move to add to the list. The function does not modify this parameter.
- **Output**: None
- **See Also**: [`moveListAdd`](<../../src/chesslib/movelist.c.md#movelistadd>)  (Implementation)


---
### moveListGet<!-- {{#callable_declaration:moveListGet}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/movelist.h#L31>)

Retrieves a move from the move list at the specified index.
- **Description**: Use this function to get a move from a `moveList` at a specific position. The function assumes that the index is within the bounds of the list, so ensure that the index is less than the size of the list to avoid undefined behavior. This function does not modify the list or its nodes.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a `moveList` from which to retrieve the move. Must not be null, and the list must be properly initialized.
    - `index`: An unsigned integer representing the position of the move to retrieve. Must be less than the size of the list to avoid undefined behavior.
- **Output**: Returns the move at the specified index in the `moveList`.
- **See Also**: [`moveListGet`](<../../src/chesslib/movelist.c.md#movelistget>)  (Implementation)


---
### moveListUndo<!-- {{#callable_declaration:moveListUndo}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/movelist.h#L32>)

Removes the last move from the move list.
- **Description**: Use this function to remove the last move from a `moveList`. It decreases the size of the list by one and updates the list's tail pointer. If the list is empty or the head is null, the function does nothing. Ensure that the list is not null before calling this function to avoid undefined behavior.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a `moveList` structure. Must not be null. The function does nothing if the list is empty or the head is null. The caller retains ownership of the list.
- **Output**: None
- **See Also**: [`moveListUndo`](<../../src/chesslib/movelist.c.md#movelistundo>)  (Implementation)


---
### moveListGetUciString<!-- {{#callable_declaration:moveListGetUciString}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/movelist.h#L35>)

Creates a UCI string from the given move list.
- **Description**: Use this function to convert a list of chess moves into a UCI (Universal Chess Interface) formatted string. This function is useful when you need to represent a sequence of moves in a standardized format. The function allocates memory for the resulting string, which the caller must free after use. If the move list is empty, the function returns an empty string. If the list contains one move, the function returns the UCI string for that move. For multiple moves, the function concatenates their UCI strings, separated by spaces, and appends a null terminator at the end.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to a `moveList` structure containing the moves to convert. Must not be null. The function does not modify the list or take ownership of it.
- **Output**: A pointer to a dynamically allocated string containing the UCI representation of the moves. The caller is responsible for freeing this memory.
- **See Also**: [`moveListGetUciString`](<../../src/chesslib/movelist.c.md#movelistgetucistring>)  (Implementation)


---
### moveListFree<!-- {{#callable_declaration:moveListFree}} -->
[View Source →](<../../../../../chesslib/include/chesslib/movelist.h#L38>)

Frees a move list and all its nodes.
- **Description**: Use this function to release the memory allocated for a `moveList` and all its associated nodes. This function must be called when the move list is no longer needed to prevent memory leaks. Ensure that the `list` parameter is not null before calling this function, as passing a null pointer will result in undefined behavior.
- **Inputs**:
    - `list`: A pointer to the `moveList` to free. Must not be null. The function will free all nodes in the list and the list itself.
- **Output**: None
- **See Also**: [`moveListFree`](<../../src/chesslib/movelist.c.md#movelistfree>)  (Implementation)
