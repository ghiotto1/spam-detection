Prints "making a new file".

# Purpose
This code is a simple script that outputs the message "making a new file" to the standard output. It does not perform any file creation or manipulation operations. The script serves a narrow purpose, primarily for displaying a message to indicate the intention or action of creating a new file, but it does not execute any file-related tasks itself.
