# Purpose
This code is a short script that outputs a single line of text to the console. It provides very narrow functionality, as its sole purpose is to print the string "this is a different new file". This type of script is often used for testing or demonstration purposes, such as verifying that a Python environment is set up correctly or that a script can execute without errors. The simplicity of the code suggests it is likely a placeholder or a starting point for further development.
