# Purpose
This code is a short script that outputs a single line of text to the console. It provides very narrow functionality, as its sole purpose is to print the string "this is a different new file". This type of script is often used for testing or demonstration purposes, such as verifying that a Python environment is set up correctly or serving as a placeholder for future development. The script does not include any variables, functions, or complex logic, making it straightforward and easy to understand.
