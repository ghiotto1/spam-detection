# Purpose
This code is a very simple script that outputs the string "new file" to the console. It provides extremely narrow functionality, serving primarily as a basic demonstration or placeholder script. The code does not perform any complex operations or computations, nor does it include any variables, functions, or external dependencies. Its purpose is likely to verify that a Python environment is set up correctly or to serve as a starting point for further development.
