# Purpose
This code is a short script that outputs the string "new file 4" to the console. It provides very narrow functionality, as it is solely focused on printing a specific message. The script does not include any variables, functions, or additional logic, indicating that its purpose is likely to serve as a placeholder or a simple test to verify that a Python environment is correctly executing print statements.
