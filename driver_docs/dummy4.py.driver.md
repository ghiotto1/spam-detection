# Purpose
This code is a very simple script that outputs the string "new file" to the console. It provides extremely narrow functionality, serving primarily as a placeholder or a basic test to ensure that a Python environment is set up correctly and can execute scripts. The script does not perform any complex operations or computations and does not include any variables, functions, or external dependencies. Its primary purpose is likely to verify that the Python interpreter is functioning as expected or to serve as a starting point for further development.
