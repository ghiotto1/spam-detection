# Purpose
This C source code file provides implementations for the [`asprintf`](#asprintf) and [`vasprintf`](#vasprintf) functions, which are used to format strings and allocate memory dynamically for them. These functions are not part of the standard C library on all systems, so this file likely serves to provide compatibility for environments where these functions are absent. The [`asprintf`](#asprintf) function formats a string and allocates enough memory to hold the resulting string, returning the number of characters printed or a negative value if an error occurs. It uses the [`vasprintf`](#vasprintf) function, which performs the same task but accepts a `va_list` argument, allowing it to be used in variadic functions. The [`vasprintf`](#vasprintf) function first calculates the required buffer size using `vsnprintf`, then allocates memory using `xcalloc` (presumably a custom memory allocation function defined elsewhere), and finally formats the string into the allocated buffer.

The file includes standard headers such as `<stdarg.h>`, `<stdio.h>`, `<string.h>`, and `<stdlib.h>`, indicating its reliance on standard I/O and memory management functions. It also includes custom headers "compat.h" and "xmalloc.h", suggesting that these headers provide additional compatibility and memory management utilities. The code is structured to handle errors gracefully, ensuring that resources are properly managed and that the caller is informed of any issues via return values. This file is likely part of a larger library or application that requires robust string formatting capabilities across different platforms, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of the underlying system's standard library support.

# Functions

---
### asprintf<!-- {{#callable:asprintf}} -->
The `asprintf` function formats a string and allocates memory for it, storing the result in a dynamically allocated buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ret`: A pointer to a char pointer where the address of the allocated buffer will be stored.
    - `fmt`: A format string that specifies how subsequent arguments are converted for output.
    - `...`: A variable number of arguments that are formatted according to the format string.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a variable argument list `ap` using `va_start` with the format string `fmt`.
    - Call [`vasprintf`](#vasprintf) with the provided arguments to format the string and allocate memory, storing the result in `ret`.
    - End the variable argument list using `va_end`.
    - Return the result of [`vasprintf`](#vasprintf), which is the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte) or a negative value if an error occurs.
- **Output**: The function returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte) or a negative value if an error occurs.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`vasprintf`](#vasprintf)

### vasprintf<!-- {{#callable:vasprintf}} -->
The `vasprintf` function formats a string and allocates memory for it, storing the result in a dynamically allocated buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ret`: A pointer to a char pointer where the address of the allocated buffer will be stored.
    - `fmt`: A format string that specifies how to format the data.
    - `ap`: A `va_list` object that contains the variable arguments to be formatted.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Create a copy of the `va_list` object `ap` into `ap2` using `va_copy`.
    - Use `vsnprintf` with a NULL buffer to calculate the size needed for the formatted string, storing the result in `n`.
    - If `vsnprintf` returns a negative value, indicating an error, jump to the error handling section.
    - Allocate memory for the formatted string using [`xcalloc`](../xmalloc.c.md#xcalloc), storing the pointer in `*ret`.
    - Use `vsnprintf` again to format the string into the allocated buffer using `ap2`.
    - If the second `vsnprintf` call fails, free the allocated memory and jump to the error handling section.
    - End the use of `ap2` with `va_end`.
    - Return the number of characters written, excluding the null terminator.
    - In the error handling section, end the use of `ap2`, set `*ret` to NULL, and return -1 to indicate failure.
- **Output**: Returns the number of characters written to the allocated buffer, excluding the null terminator, or -1 if an error occurs.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`xcalloc`](../xmalloc.c.md#xcalloc)
