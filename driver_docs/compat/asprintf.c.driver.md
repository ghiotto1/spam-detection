# Purpose
This C source code file provides implementations for the [`asprintf`](#asprintf) and [`vasprintf`](#vasprintf) functions, which are used to format strings with dynamic memory allocation. The [`asprintf`](#asprintf) function formats a string and allocates enough memory to hold the resulting string, returning the number of characters printed or a negative value if an error occurs. It uses [`vasprintf`](#vasprintf), which performs the same task but accepts a `va_list` argument, allowing it to be used in variadic functions. The code includes necessary headers for standard input/output operations and memory management, and it relies on a custom `xmalloc` function for memory allocation, which is presumably defined in the included "xmalloc.h" file. This file is likely part of a larger project that requires portable implementations of these functions, as suggested by the inclusion of "compat.h".

# Functions

---
### asprintf<!-- {{#callable:asprintf}} -->
The `asprintf` function formats a string and allocates memory for it, storing the result in a dynamically allocated buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ret`: A pointer to a char pointer where the address of the allocated buffer will be stored.
    - `fmt`: A format string that specifies how subsequent arguments are converted for output.
    - `...`: A variable number of arguments that are formatted according to the format string.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a variable argument list `ap` using `va_start` with the format string `fmt`.
    - Call [`vasprintf`](#vasprintf) with the provided arguments to format the string and allocate memory, storing the result in `ret`.
    - End the variable argument list using `va_end`.
    - Return the result of [`vasprintf`](#vasprintf), which is the number of characters printed or a negative value if an error occurs.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte) or a negative value if an error occurs.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`vasprintf`](#vasprintf)

### vasprintf<!-- {{#callable:vasprintf}} -->
The `vasprintf` function formats a string and allocates memory for it, storing the result in a dynamically allocated buffer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `ret`: A pointer to a char pointer where the address of the allocated buffer will be stored.
    - `fmt`: A format string that specifies how to format the data.
    - `ap`: A `va_list` object that contains the variable arguments to be formatted.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Create a copy of the `va_list` object `ap` into `ap2` using `va_copy` to preserve the original list for reuse.
    - Call `vsnprintf` with a NULL buffer to calculate the size needed for the formatted string, storing the result in `n`.
    - If `vsnprintf` returns a negative value, indicating an error, jump to the error handling section.
    - Allocate memory for the formatted string using [`xmalloc`](../xmalloc.c.driver.md#xmalloc), with a size of `n + 1` to accommodate the null terminator.
    - Call `vsnprintf` again with the allocated buffer to actually format the string, using `ap2` for the arguments.
    - If the second `vsnprintf` call fails, free the allocated memory and jump to the error handling section.
    - End the use of `ap2` with `va_end`.
    - Return the number of characters written, excluding the null terminator, if successful.
    - In the error handling section, end the use of `ap2`, set `*ret` to NULL, and return -1 to indicate failure.
- **Output**:
    - The function returns the number of characters written to the allocated buffer, excluding the null terminator, or -1 if an error occurs.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`xmalloc`](../xmalloc.c.driver.md#xmalloc)
