# Purpose
This code is a very simple script that outputs the string "new file" to the console. It provides extremely narrow functionality, serving primarily as a placeholder or a basic test to ensure that the Python environment is set up correctly and can execute a script. This type of code is often used as a starting point when creating a new Python file, allowing developers to verify that the file is being executed as expected. There are no variables, functions, or complex logic involved, making it a straightforward example of a minimal Python script.
